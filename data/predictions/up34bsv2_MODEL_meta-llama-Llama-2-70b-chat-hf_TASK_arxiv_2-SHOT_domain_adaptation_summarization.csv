TEXT: according to standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) hierarchical clustering theory , there should be numerous low mass dark matter halos present in the universe today . if these halos contain sufficient stars , they should be detectable as dwarf galaxies . observationally this appears to be true for clusters of galaxies where the galactic density is high , but not so for the lower density environments . we conducted a search for these objects in the millennium galaxy strip which runs along the celestial equator in the field , passing through filaments and voids . it is therefore an excellent data set for studies into the influence of the environment on dwarf galaxy populations . we compare these results with those from similar surveys carried out in the virgo and ursa major ( uma ) clusters . our results are unique as the three surveys were conducted using the same instrument , same technique ( exposure time , filter band ) and same selection criteria , thus we can be sure that we are comparing like with like.    low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are difficult to detect as their surface brightnesses are below that of the sky ( @xmath0 ) . the detection algorithm that we developed for this project is optimised for the detection of faint , diffuse objects on ccd frames ( see sabatini et al . 2003 ) . to ensure that the objects picked out by the algorithm are actually dwarf galaxies and not background contamination , a selection criteria based on morphology and magnitude is applied to the objects . this criteria was chosen following simulations of a cone of the universe randomly populated with galaxies , as detailed in roberts et al ( 2003 ) . .summary of results for the three surveys , compared with predictions from cdm [ cols=""^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     we have presented the results obtained for 3 surveys carried out in very different environments ( table 1 ) . we find a dgr in the field of 6:1 , compared to a value of 20:1 in the virgo cluster . this very large ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies found in the virgo cluster indicates that this region is very different to lower density clusters such as uma , and the field where we find relatively few dwarfs . our results for the dgr of the mgs are consistent with those derived from the recent redshift survey determinations of the field lf made by 2df ( norberg et al . 2002 ) even though we sample to some two magnitudes fainter in central surface brightness and magnitude . there is no hidden population of dwarf galaxies that have been missed by the redshift surveys . these observational results are in disagreement with most predictions made by cdm models , commonly referred to as the substructure problem . the models predict far more small dark matter halos than observations detect ( kauffman et al . 1993 ) . a number of theories have been put forward to explain the apparent difference in the observed number of dwarf galaxies in different environments . these range from those which try and explain how more dwarfs may form in rich environments , such as galaxy harassment ( moore et al 1996 ) or the external pressure confining the ejected galaxy gas ( babul & rees 1992 ) , to those ideas which emphasise the suppression of dwarf galaxy formation in the field such as supernovae wind expulsion and galaxy squelching ( tully et al 2002 ) . detailed observations of dwarf galaxies provide a challenge to the concordance cosmological model to which cdm is central . dwarf galaxies are found in large numbers in rich clusters , but not in less dense galactic environments . for the cdm model to remain viable it has to provide a satisfactory solution to this problem . at present , it is not clear which , if any , of the mechanisms described above would be the best to help provide this solution . babul , a. , & rees , m.j . , 1992 , , 255 , 346b kauffmann , g. , white , s.d.m . , guideroni , b. , 1993 , , 264 , 201 moore , b. , lake , g. , quinn , t. , stadel , j . , 1999 , , 304 , 465 m norberg et al . , 2002 , , 336 , 907 roberts , s. , davies , j. , sabatini , s. , baes , m. , linder , s. , smith , r. , evans , rh . , 2003 , submitted sabatini , s. , davies , j. , scaramella , r. , smith , r. , baes , m. , linder , s.m . , roberts , s. , testa , v. , 2003 , , 342 , 981 tully , r.b . , somerville , r.s . , trentham , n. , verheijen , m.a.w . , 2002 , , 569 , 573

SUMMARY:kpd0005 + 5106 is the hottest known helium - rich white dwarf . 
 we have identified lines in uv and optical spectra and conclude that it is significantly hotter than previously thought , namely @xmath0  k instead of 120000  k. this is a possible explanation for the observed hard x - ray emission as being of photospheric origin . concerning its evolutionary state , we suggest that kpd0005 + 5106 is not a descendant of a pg1159 star but more probably related to the o(he ) stars and rcrb stars .

 two types of models have this property : scalar fields with unconventional kinetic term and models with cosmological constant and a slowly decaying cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in this work 
 we investigate the possibility of replacing the cosmological constant in the latter models with gradual condensation of a scalar field produced during the decay of the cdm and present some preliminary results . 
 the advantage of this class of models to the ordinary quintessence is that the evolution of the dark energy and cdm are correlated and cosmological coincidence problem is solved or at least reduced to the fine tuning of the coupling between decaying cdm and quintessence field i.e the hierarchy problem . 
 here we show that for part of the parameter space these models are consistent with present estimation of cosmological parameters .    *

2,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: there exist three important correlations @xcite among the observed characteristics of spiral and irregular galaxies : 1 ) the mass - metallicity relation : the more luminous the galaxy the higher its abundance ; 2 ) the correlation between abundance and morphological type : earlier type galaxies have larger abundances than later type ones ; and 3 ) the correlation between the radial gradient of abundances and the morphological type : the radial gradient of abundances is larger for later type galaxies than for earlier ones . the problem appears when we see that the mass metallicity relation seems to be the same for bright spirals and low - mass irregular galaxies while the correlation between the radial gradient and the morphological type has an effect on - off : when the galaxy mass decreases or the hubble type changes to the latest irregulars , the steep radial gradient disappears and the abundance pattern becomes uniform for the whole disk .    to study correlations with a large number of galaxies for which we need a large number of models . for that , we build a bi - parametric grid of theoretical models depending on the galaxy total mass and morphological type . the scenario of the multiphase model begins with a spheroidal protogalaxy sliced into cylindrical regions . the gas of the protogalaxy has a mass m(r ) computed from the rotation curve v(r ) , which we take from to calculate radial mass distributions m(r ) for any value of the luminosity . this gas collapses onto the equatorial plane and forms out the disk . the infall rate is inversely proportional to a characteristic collapse time scale , which changes according to the total mass of the galaxy : @xmath0^{1/2}\ ] ]    this implies that the characteristic collapse time scale @xmath1 is longer for the less massive galaxies . there exist different phases of matter in each radial cylinder : diffuse gas , molecular clouds , massive stars , low and intermediate mass stars , and remnants . the star formation in the halo follows a schmidt law . in the disk the star formation has 2 steps : molecular clouds are formed from the diffuse gas . then , stars form through cloud - cloud collisions , and from the interaction between massive stars and molecular clouds . every processes rates change along the galactocentric radius due to the volume of each region through a proportionality coefficient called efficiency or probability . only the last described process does not change with r being constant for all galaxies . moreover , the efficiency to form stars in the halo is assumed as constant for all halos . thus , only efficiencies to form molecular clouds and to form stars from collisions among these ones , are variable for each galaxy . the initial mass function was taken from and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions are taken from for @xmath2 , for stars @xmath3 and for sn - i . we compute models for 44 radial mass distributions , and 10 different values of efficiencies between 0 and 1 which are equivalent to 10 morphological types , for each one . more details about models and results are described in . these models reproduce the 3 cited correlations as wee see in the following two figures . in fig . [ oh ] the radial distributions of the oxygen abundances , given by @xmath4 , are shown for 3 different rotation velocities as marked in panels . ten different evolutionary rates or efficiencies , representing ten hubble types , from @xmath5 , the top solid line , up @xmath6 , the bottom line with squares ( @xmath7 ) as symbols , are drawing for each one of them . the more massive galaxies have strong abumndance radial gradients only for the latest types ( @xmath8 ) , except @xmath6 which is flat , while the earliest ones have very flat radial distributions . the intermediate mass galaxies show steep radial distributions for the intermediate types ( @xmath9 ) , the latest ones being rather flat . the less massive galaxies have no gradients for types later than 7 , all the others showing very steep radial distributions . the described behavior is in agreement with the observed correlations . it is also clear from the same fig . [ oh ] that a minimum level of abundances is around 7.5 dex , which is the value found in the less enriched hii regions .      in fig . [ oh_mb ] , panel a ) we represent the same oxygen abundances obtained with our 440 models for every radial regions as a function of the stellar magnitude of the same region , computed by assuming a ratio @xmath10 . these relation can not be exactly compared with data panel b)- which represent characteristic oxygen abundances _ vs _ the magnitude of each galaxy , that is integrated quantities for a given galaxy , instead the local characteristics represented by the models . however , we can see that the correlation resulting from models have the same behavior than observations .
SUMMARY:a generalization of the multiphase chemical evolution model applied to a wide set of theoretical galaxies is shown . 
 this set of models has been computed by using the so - called universal rotation curve from @xcite to calculate the radial mass distributions of each theoretical galaxy . by assuming that the molecular cloud and star formation efficiencies depend on the morphological type of each galaxy , we construct a bi - parametric grid of models whose results are valid in principle for any spiral galaxy , of given maximum rotation velocity or total mass , and morphological type .

TEXT: the variation of the initial mass function ( imf ) with the environment is a key problem in star formation , but any dependence of the imf with the ambient conditions has been difficult to determine . most surveys have concentrated on the most compact regions with the highest density of stars and gas , while extended , sparse groups of nearby young stars have not been studied with the same sensitivity , mainly because of the large area of the sky that they span . therefore , meaningful comparisons of the imf in differing conditions have not been readily available . this situation is changing with the advent of large - format ccd detectors , making possible deep surveys of the less embeded , more extended star - forming complexes . with a modest extinction ( av @xmath2 ) and low density of stars ( n@xmath3 pc@xmath4 ) taurus is an example of the `` non - clustered '' mode of star formation , making it an ideal laboratory for comparison with high density regions like young clusters . we used the 8k @xmath58k ccd mosaic camera with @xmath6 filters on the kpno 0.9 m telescope ( @xmath7 fov ) to observe eight fields in taurus to an @xmath8 . with @xmath6 photometry and @xmath9 data from the 2mass , we performed a reddening limited ( av@xmath2 ) search for candidate young ( @xmath10 myr ) low - mass stars and brown dwarfs down to @xmath11 ( details in briceo et al . we then used the k and na gravity - sensitive features in follow up spectra to confirm membership .    among the new members is an m9.5 brown dwarf ( figure 1a ) , the least massive object identified so far in taurus ( @xmath12 using the temperature scale of luhman [ 2000 ] and evolutionary tracks of baraffe et al . [ 1998 ] ) . this object exhibits significant near - ir excess and strong h@xmath13 emission ( w[h@xmath14=150$] ) , indicative of ongoing accretion from a circumstellar disk and evidence that brown dwarfs , like stars , can form from fragmentation processes . we construct an imf for our taurus fields and compare it with the imf for the trapezium cluster ( figure 1b ) . we find that the ratio of substellar to stellar objects in the trapezium is @xmath1 larger than in taurus ; the scarcity of brown dwarfs may be due to the higher value of the jeans mass in taurus , which results from the lower surface density of gas in this region .
SUMMARY:we present the results of a deep , optical / ir wide field imaging survey of selected fields in the nearby ( d@xmath0 pc ) taurus star - forming region . 
 we report the discovery of 9 new members with spectral types m5.75-m9.5 . 
 we derive an initial mass function encompassing 54% of the known members in taurus . 
 comparison with dense regions like the trapezium cluster in orion shows that taurus has produced @xmath1 less brown dwarfs . 
 we suggest that the lower frequency of brown dwarfs in taurus may result from the low - density star - forming environment , leading to larger minimum jeans masses .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: it is well recognized that the evolution of stars mainly depends on their initial mass , partly on the chemical composition . however what determines the stellar mass is poorly understood . the origin of the stellar mass spectrum is thought to be closely related to star formation processes . and therefore the initial mass function ( imf ) , the mass distribution of stars from a single star formation event , is a crucial diagnostic tool with which to understand star formation processes .    although the imf seems to be universal according to a number of previous studies ( ( * ? ? ? * bastian , covey , & meyer 2010 ) ) , many evidences for the variation of the imf have been reported both from observational and theoretical studies ( ( * ? ? ? * lu et al . 2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * marks et al . 2012 ) ; etc ) . one of main reasons for this debate may be caused by the use of inhomogeneous data . thus , we focus on the results from a homogeneous imaging survey of young open clusters in the galaxy ( `` sejong open cluster survey ''  ( * ? ? ? * sung et al . 2013 ) ) . the young open clusters are useful objects in the study of the imf because they are not only a coeval and co - spatial population but also an ecological indicator in the galaxy . we investigated the imf of 16 famous young open clusters by analyzing their hertzsprung - russell diagrams . the upper left - hand panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows their imf and its slope @xmath5 ( the data from ( * ? ? ? * lim 2014 ) , references therein , and ongoing work ) . variations of the slope @xmath5 with respect to the surface density and total mass of the clusters are shown in the upper right and lower left - hand panels , respectively . the slope of the imf in the high - mass regime ( @xmath6 ) appears to be shallow for massive dense clusters . the maximum stellar mass is also larger for more massive clusters ( lower right - hand panel ) . this @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is consistent with results from analytic approaches ( ( * ? ? ? * elmegreen 2000 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * larson 2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * bonnell , bate , & vine 2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * weidner & kroupa 2004 ) ) . it may imply the deterministic origin of the stellar mass . the galactic variations of the imf and the cluster properties were also investigated to simply test the environmental influences on the star formation processes . the massive dense clusters tend to be formed in the inner galaxy , while the formation of less massive sparse clusters seem to be dominant in the outer galaxy . we tentatively suggest that the star formation is likely to be controlled by local environmental conditions rather than a universal process .     with respect to the surface density of the clusters ( upper right ) and the cluster mass ( lower left ) , and a dependency of maximum stellar masses on the mass of host clusters ( lower right ) . in the lower right - hand panel , the dot - dashed , dotted , dashed , and solid lines show @xmath7-@xmath8 relations from analytic approaches of ( * ? ? ? * elmegreen ( 2000 ) ) , ( * ? ? ? * larson ( 2003 ) ) , ( * ? ? ? * bonnell , bate , & vine ( 2003 ) ) , and ( * ? ? ? * weidner & kroupa ( 2004 ) ) , respectively . , width=336 ]
SUMMARY:the initial mass function ( imf ) is an essential tool with which to study star formation processes . 
 we have initiated the photometric survey of young open clusters in the galaxy , from which the stellar imfs are obtained in a homogeneous way . 
 a total of 16 famous young open clusters have preferentially been studied up to now . 
 these clusters have a wide range of surface densities ( @xmath0 to 3 [ stars pc@xmath1 for stars with mass larger than 5@xmath2 ) and cluster masses ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) , and also are distributed in five different spiral arms in the galaxy . 
 it is possible to test the dependence of star formation processes on the global properties of individual clusters or environmental conditions .

4,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the optimization problem of packing regular tetrahedra densely in space has seen invigorated interest over the last few years @xcite . this interest has helped drive up the packing fraction of the densest - known such packings from @xmath2 in 2006 @xcite to @xmath3 @xcite most recently ( see table 3 ) . these improved packing fractions have been obtained from more and more complex packings , with larger and larger repeating units . this trend has led some to conjecture that the densest packing of tetrahedra might have inherent disorder @xcite . the more restrictive problem of packing tetrahedra transitively  that is , so that all tetrahedra in the packing are equivalent ( a more rigorous definition is given below )  has been less extensively studied and the densest previously - reported transitive packing of regular tetrahedra fills only @xmath4 of space @xcite . here we present a one - parameter family of transitive but dense packings of tetrahedra with the packing fraction @xmath0 . the discovery of this family of dense packings was inspired by the results of a numerical search , which yielded a dense packing with similar structural properties to the packing we present . the numerical method used was adapted from the _ divide and concur _ approach to constraint satisfaction problems @xcite . the _ divide and concur _ formalism enables us to set up an efficient search through the parameter space consisting of the positions and orientations of tetrahedra inside the repeating unit and the translation vectors governing its lattice repetition , subject to the constraint that no two tetrahedra overlap . the dynamics involved in the _ divide and concur _ search are highly non - physical , which might explain why our method was able to discover this dense packing , while earlier methods involving more physical dynamics were not @xcite . in this note we present only the analytically constructed packing without a full explication of the numerical method , which will be forthcoming . the construction of the dimer - double - lattice family of packings in terms of the parameter @xmath5 in a general monoclinic coordinate basis ( @xmath6 ) . the packing is generated starting from the fundamental tetrahedron by the action of the space group . a packing of regular tetrahedra is obtained when the general monoclinic coordinate basis reduces to the specified orthogonal coordinate basis . [ cols= "" < , < "" , ] in table 3 , we compare the packings presented here to other studied packings of regular tetrahedra . both packings are denser than the densest previously - reported transitive packing , a double lattice presented by conway and torquato ( which we call the `` warp - and - weft '' packing due to the interweaving arrangement of its tetrahedra ) @xcite , and the dimer double lattice is denser than any previously - reported packing . the results presented go against the recent trend of ever - growing repeating units in densest - known packings and demonstrate that a large repeating unit is not a necessary property of a dense packing of regular tetrahedra . it is curious that previous simulations , utilizing a more physical search dynamic @xcite , yielded dense packings that were either disordered , had quasicrytalline order , or had crystalline order characterized by a very large repeating unit , and were not able to find the denser class of structures presented here , ( reminiscent perhaps of kurt vonnegut s ice - nine , a fictional phase of water that is more stable , but kinetically unreachable ) . our results yield the surprising situation wherein the densest - known packing of icosahedra is now sparser than the corresponding packing of tetrahedra , a solid which just four years ago was a prime candidate for a counterexample of a conjecture by ulam that the sphere is the sparsest - packing convex solid @xcite . as the packing can be generally extended to any tetrahedron in a three - parameter family generated by deformations of the monoclinic coordinate basis , if any tetrahedron provides a counterexample of ulam s conjecture , it is not a tetrahedron of that family . the regular tetrahedron is no longer outcast , as it long was , from the respectable family of convex polyhedra whose largest - achieved packing density is realized by a transitive arrangement . while there are some convex solids whose maximum packing density clearly can not be achieved by a transitive arrangement ( the convex schmitt - conway - danzer polyhedron can tile space , but only in aperiodic and non - transitive ways @xcite ) , the majority of regular and semi - regular polyhedra have been to - date packed most densely in transitive packings @xcite . whether this situation is accidental , the result of bias favoring the discovery of transitive packings , or a more fundamental property governing the packing of a certain class of solids is still an open question .
SUMMARY:we present a one - parameter family of periodic packings of regular tetrahedra , with the packing fraction @xmath0 , that are simple in the sense that they are transitive and their repeating units involve only four tetrahedra . 
 the construction of the packings was inspired from results of a numerical search that yielded a similar packing . 
 we present an analytic construction of the packings and a description of their properties . 
 we also present a transitive packing with a repeating unit of two tetrahedra and a packing fraction @xmath1 .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: most of the higgs efforts of the cdf and collaborations are centered on finding a standard model higgs boson . however the standard model is incomplete and there are proposed extensions to the standard model , many of which feature one or more higgs bosons as well . these are often similar to the standard model higgs , but differ in their couplings to other particles . for the purposes of this presentation , i divide the higgs searches into two categories , fermiophobic higgs searches and susy higgs searches at high @xmath0 . in the fermiophobic higgs models , the higgs is assumed not to couple to fermions . at high masses it then decays to a w pair and at low masses to a photon pair . the high mass searches are done in the channel , searching for a higgs boson produced in association with a w boson . this is done in order to avoid the higher backgrounds associated with the channel .    the search for  @xcite looks for two same sign leptons and vetos on a third lepton . the sample is then divided according to lepton types . the final limit is extracted from the dilepton invariant mass distribution . the results can be seen in figure  [ p03 ] . the cdf search for  @xcite also looks for exactly two leptons of the same sign and divides the sample by lepton type , but it performs a simple counting experiment instead of extracting the limit from the dilepton invariant mass . the results can be seen in figure  [ p04 ] .    performed a search for  @xcite . that search employs a neural network to distinguish between photons and jets . the diphoton mass spectrum is then scanned for an excess and a mass dependent limit is set . the results can be seen in figure  [ p05 ] .    also performed a search for  @xcite . the basic idea is that the vertex @xmath1 is suppressed and instead the vertex @xmath2 is employed , where @xmath3 is another higgs boson . the search only looks for three photons , allowing one photon to be lost . a cut on the transverse momentum of the photons is employed to separate out the background , and the remaining events are treated as a counting experiment . the results can be seen in figure  [ p06 ] . the susy higgs searches exploit the fact that at high @xmath0 the coupling of the higgs to bottom quark and tau leptons is enhanced with @xmath4 , which has a number of effects that are exploited in the search . the higgs cross section increases from femtobarns to picobarns . the higgs is often produced by the fusion of two bottom quarks producing a final state with two extra bottom quarks , which can be tagged to reduce backgrounds . furthermore the higgs decay changes and is in 90% of cases a pair of bottom quarks and in the remaining 10% into a pair of tau leptons . cdf performed a search for  @xcite , where the choice of one associated bottom jet was due to the better signal to background ratio compared to zero or two associated bottom jets . in the search the two and three jet distributions are fit to obtain the signal and background distributions . from this , mass dependent cross section limits are obtained , and @xmath0 limits which take the higgs width effects at high @xmath0 . the results can be seen in figure  [ p09 ] .    also performed a search for  @xcite . for the search the data is split into three , four and five jet bins . within these bins the two and three jet distributions are fit to obtain the signal and background contributions . from these the mass dependent @xmath0 limit is extracted . the results can be seen in figure  [ p10 ] . cdf performed a search for  @xcite . due to the higher purity of the ditau sample no additional bottom jets are required . the sample is split according to the tau decay mode . the signal template is fit to the ditau visible mass spectrum to obtain the mass and model dependent @xmath0 limits . the results can be seen in figure  [ p11 ] .    performed two searches for higgs decaying into a tau pair  @xcite . the one search is in the channel . for this the sample is divided by tau decay type and run period . the signal template is then fit to the visible mass spectrum to extract the model and mass dependent @xmath0 limit . the results can be seen in figure  [ p12 ] . the other search is in the search , which tags an additional bottom quark to reduce the background rate . one tau is required to decay to a muon , while the other is required to decay hadronically . the sample is then divided according to the hadronic tau decay type . in each decay category a counting experiment is performed to extract the model and mass dependent @xmath0 limits . the results can be seen in figure  [ p13 ] . the cdf and collaborations have performed a large number of searches for signs of a fermiophobic or susy higgs . in the absence of signal , limits have been set on the various models . for the near future , updates to several of these searches can be expected , as well as a combination of these searches into an overall tevatron limit .
SUMMARY:we present an overview of the full range of higgs searches in models beyond the standard model at the tevatron . 
 this includes both searches for fermiophobic higgs and for susy higgs at high @xmath0 . 
 no excess is seen in the data , so model dependent limits are set .

TEXT: as soon as kuhn understood the flexibility of polymer chains , and the origin of rubber elasticity , his student a.  katchalsky thought about the possibility of transforming chemical energy into mechanical energy , using gels swollen by water . his first idea is explained on fig.[fig1 ] . starting from chains which carry acid groups @xmath0 and adding @xmath1 ions , one obtains a charged network @xmath2 where the chains stretch by electrostatic repulsions . if one then adds @xmath3 , the system returns to neutral , and the gel contracts . [ h ]    pgg1nov.eps    this system , however , does not allow for many cycles . adding @xmath1 really means adding soda @xmath4 and adding @xmath3 means adding hydrochloric acid @xmath5 .  at each cycle , one thus adds one mole of @xmath6 , and this ionic solute screens  out the electrostatic interactions : the system dies out fast . katchalsky solved this problem by an intelligent trick : he used ion exchange @xmath7 against @xmath8 where @xmath9 binds  two @xmath2 groups and contracts the gel . his group produced active fibers of this type@xcite @xmath10 however , the process did not gave rise to useful applications , for a number of reasons :    \1 ) time constants : what is implied here is diffusion of ions  from a bath to a fiber , and diffusion is always very slow . and even if the ions were injected locally ( by highly divided electrodes , or , by conducting polymers ) the diffusion of water remains necessary to swell or deswell . \2 ) fatigue : if we swell a gel by water , the swelling process starts at the outer surface , and creates huge mechanical tensions in a thin region : buckling instabilities occur@xmath11 and fractures show up .  there is little hope for an artificial muscle which breaks locally at each cycle .    in the following section , we present two attempts where these difficulties are taken into account .  it may well be that none of them gives a durable answer , but the trends are interesting . the starting point here is a nematic network schematized on fig.[fig2 ] . at low temperatures , the system is elongated .  at higher temperatures , above the nematic isotropic transition point @xmath12 , the network contracts . networks of this type have been synthetised by a very intelligent technique @xcite .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: r0.5        the development of the tpc readout electronics with time - to - digit converters(tdc ) is carried out in the line of the electronics work - package of the lctpc collaboration@xcite . time of arrival and charge of signals from tpc pads are measured with the help of a time - to - digital converter . the charge is measured indirectly , with help of a charge - to - time converter(qtc ) - the charge is encoded into the pulse width on the output of the qtc . + for smaller input signals , the output pulse width is shorter , figure [ fig : tq ] . in order to accommodate for large dynamic range of signals from tpc , it is convenient to use , for example , log - like charge - to - time conversion characteristics . current implementation@xcite of the readout electronics uses asdq chips . this circuit offers simple timing method with threshold discriminator . the method gives good results in applications with steep signal edges , like in proportional counters . for a gem tpc detector , where signals are induced on pads , timing performance need to be optimized . + the subject of this work is the simulation of the signals induced on pads of a gem tpc detector . derivation of signals induced on the pads of a gem tpc detector can be done by using the ramo s theorem@xcite : @xmath0    r0.5        current @xmath1 is induced in a pad by charge @xmath2 moving with velocity @xmath3 . here charge is considered to be point - like . @xmath4 is the weighting field . the weighting field is defined by unit potential on the pad under consideration in the absence of the charge , while all other surrounding electrodes are at zero potential . effectively , the weighting field shows coupling of a charge to the pad . convenient way to calculate the weighting field in a multi - electrode configuration is to use a finite element method . in this work _ cst studio suite_@xcite was used . an example of the weighting field is shown on figure [ fig : wfield ] . the weighting field visualized in the form of potential lines on a vertical plane cutting a pad at the middle . in this example , the pad has squared shape . note how the potential lines gets denser in vicinity of the pad .    in a real gem tpc , signals typically induced by a cluster of charges with finite size , therefore one would need to combine results of individual signal inductions . position of individual charges in a cloud can be found with the help of a tpc simulation program , for example marlin - tpc@xcite . hereinafter only point - like charges will be considered . r0.5        a charge moves under the influence of the electric field applied between the gem surface and the pads . drift velocity ( and therefore drift time ) of the charge depends on the magnitude of the electric field . the drift time define the period of signal development and it is typically of the order of . + assume the charge drifts without diffusion , strictly along the z - axis , figure [ fig : wfield ] . in this case , the shape of the induced signal is given by the z - component of the weighting field , figure [ fig : signal ] . note the signal peaks as the charge approaches the pad . compared to proportional counters , signal from a gem detector has an order of magnitude longer front edge . this implies that in the current implementation of the readout electronics may not necessary be optimal for this application , so that the timing performance might be insufficient . one of the possibilities to improve timing performance would be to reduce the size of the induction gap , reducing the drift time of the charges . however this might negatively effect performance of the coordinate reconstruction in the x - y plane . another possibility is to study other methods of timing , for example , peak detecting circuit . + integral of the induced current gives the total accumulated charge on the pad . for different y - positions of the charge one can obtain different waveforms and therefore - set of signal charges induced on the pad . this gives direct input to the calculation of the pad response function of the pad . further development of the tpc readout electronics will require optimization of its performance . for this purpose , gem tpc signal simulation is being prepared and will have to be combined with a tpc simulation package . it is planned to study gem signals from an existing small gem tpc detector . this will help to verify the simulation of gem signals . this can be performed with a small gem chamber with short drift distance . j.  abernathy _ et al . _ , `` marlintpc : a marlin based common tpc software framework for the lc - tpc collaboration , '' _ in the proceedings of 2007 international linear collider workshop ( lcws07 and ilc07 ) , hamburg , germany , 30 may - 3 jun 2007 , pp trk01 _ [ arxiv:0709.0790 [ physics.ins-det ] ] .

TEXT: over the last decades , there has been a surge in research activities in the physical properties of biopolymers , such as double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) , filamental actin ( f - actin ) and microtubules . semiflexibility is a common feature they share : they preserve mechanical rigidity over a range , characterised by the persistence length @xmath2 , along their contour . ( e.g. , for a dsdna , f - actin and microtubules , @xmath3 nm @xcite , @xmath4 m @xcite and @xmath5 mm @xcite respectively . ) recently , two of us introduced a bead - spring model for semiflexible polymers @xcite . the model has four parameters . three of them determine the mechanical properties : the average inter - bead distance @xmath6 , the longitudinal stiffness @xmath7 , and the bending stiffness @xmath8 . the fourth parameter is related to the viscosity of water @xmath9 and sets the time scale . in earlier work @xcite we determined a set of values for the first three parameters that are able to reproduce the mechanical properties of double - stranded dna in experiment , and we studied the canonical averages of a number of equilibrium properties . in most of the present paper , we restrict ourselves to the same set of parameter values .    in this paper , we primarily discuss how the equations of motion of our model can be efficiently integrated in time . there is no hydrodynamic interactions among the beads . this is in fact not a problem when it comes to comparing to experimental results for dsdna segments up to a few persistence lengths , since at these lengths a semiflexible polymer does not form a coil , and therefore should be free - draining . indeed , this is the feature that allows us to meaningfully compare the diffusion coefficients of short model dsdna segments to those from experiments , from which we determine the fourth ( and the last ) parameter of the model , @xmath9 , which describes the langevin friction on the beads .    the default simulation approach to integrate the corresponding langevin equations of motion in time for our model would be a simple integration scheme such as the euler method , using the bead positions as dynamical variables . in this paper we develop a time - forward integration scheme by using the properties of ( a very good approximation of ) the polymer s fluctuation modes in this model @xcite , and allowing a set of representative equilibrium and dynamical observables to differ by at most 5% , we achieve 2 - 3 orders of magnitude speed - ups in comparison to the default method . with average inter - bead distance @xmath10 nm as a model parameter , the length of a dsdna basepair , the maximum size @xmath11 of the time step is summarised in table [ table0 ] . the variation in @xmath12 with @xmath13 does not have significant consequences since @xmath12 enters the dynamical equations only in the form of @xmath14 . the decrease of @xmath15 with increasing @xmath13 , on the other hand , has much more severe consequences on the dynamics , as it makes the chain effectively more inextensible . in contrast to dsdna one already runs into  even for fairly mild coarse - graining  quite small values of @xmath15 . e.g. , for @xmath16 , which would mean about 75 beads per persistence length , the value of @xmath15 is so small that for all practical purposes our model behaves ( except of course the force - extension curve ) as the inextensible wlc , and our maximum time - step then would then be @xmath17 . even more interesting is the ratio between the real time and the scaled time involving the @xmath13-dependent parameters [ c.f . ( [ g2a ] ) ] : @xmath18 e.g. , even with a small maximal allowable timestep @xmath19 the large value of @xmath20 for @xmath16 leads to @xmath21 this is orders of magnitude larger than the order of picosecond estimates for @xmath22 for dsdna .
SUMMARY:using a recently developed bead - spring model for semiflexible polymers that takes into account their natural extensibility , we report an efficient algorithm to simulate the dynamics for polymers like double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . 
 the dsdna is modelled with one bead - spring element per basepair , and the polymer dynamics is described by the langevin equation . 
 the key to efficiency is that we describe the equations of motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer s fluctuation modes , as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the beads . 
 we show that , within an accuracy tolerance level of @xmath0 of several key observables , the model allows for single langevin time steps of @xmath1 , 8 , 16 and 16 ps for a dsdna model - chain consisting of 64 , 128 , 256 and 512 basepairs ( i.e. , chains of 0.55 , 1.11 , 2.24 and 4.48 persistence lengths ) respectively . 
 correspondingly , in one hour , a standard desktop computer can simulate 0.23 , 0.56 , 0.56 and 0.26 ms of these dsdna chains respectively . 
 we compare our results to those obtained from other methods , in particular , the ( inextensible discretised ) wlc model . 
 importantly , we demonstrate that at the same level of discretisation , i.e. , when each discretisation element is one basepair long , our algorithm gains about 5 - 6 orders of magnitude in the size of time steps over the inextensible wlc model . 
 further , we show that our model can be mapped one - on - one to a discretised version of the extensible wlc model ; implying that the speed - up we achieve in our model must hold equally well for the latter . 
 we also demonstrate the use of the method by simulating efficiently the tumbling behaviour of a dsdna segment in a shear flow .

 the method was expected to generate trajectories that have minimal failures and pose estimation errors over varying maps . 
 through various experiments , the effectiveness of a slam - safe planner that predicts failures and executes recovery actions to continue the navigation task was proven . 
 in terms of learning slam - safe behaviour , the method showed an increase in performance by about 50% as compared to supervised learning methods . 
 in terms of slam recovery during trajectory planning , the method showed about 70% improvement in comparison with a state - of - the - art trajectory planner and about 45% in comparison with supervised learning based planners . 
 the paper establishes that a rl framework is able to learn precisely those actions resorted by humans when they use a handheld camera or teleoperate a robot for slam . 
 for example , this involves slow transitions to newer scenes avoiding sharp turns by repeated back and","effective slam using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its simplicity . however , when compared to trajectory planning methods using depth - based slam , monocular slam in loop does need additional considerations . 
 one main reason being that for the optimization , in the form of bundle adjustment ( ba ) , to be robust , the slam system needs to scan the area for a reasonable duration . 
 most monocular slam systems do not tolerate large camera rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown . 
 other reasons for monocular slam failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the essential matrix , feature - sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart from ba . 
 this paper presents a novel formulation based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the slam generated outputs ( scene structure and camera motion ) do not deviate largely from their true values . 
 quintessentially , the rl framework successfully learns the otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that result in trajectories that do not cause failure of slam , which are almost intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation . 
 we show systematically in simulations how the quality of the slam map and trajectory dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using rl .",0.405,0.058,0.153," simultaneous planning localization and mapping ( splam ) or active slam has been a popular area of research over the years @xcite . the main theme is to compute a set of control actions for the mobile robot such that either the uncertainty of the robot or the combined uncertainty of robot and map states are bounded . traditionally , splam frameworks have been approached through either model predictive control @xcite or information gain @xcite paradigms . in recent times , belief space planning paradigms have tended to compute the control law in continuous domain @xcite taking a leaf out of slam frameworks that model it as a least squares problem @xcite .    however , all of the above works assume the availability of immediate range data and uncertainty estimates for the map . some of them , such as @xcite , also assume the availability of dense range data transposed to an occupancy grid map . in contrast , in a monocular slam setting , the following complexities get accrued :    * sparse depth estimates , which are highly inaccurate in textureless or low texture scenes * degeneracies in camera motion estimation such as in planar scenes or for in - place rotation of the camera * highly non linear nature of the camera projection operation since a monocular camera is not a depth sensor but a projective sensor    [ cols= "" < , < "" , ] in this paper , we proposed a reinforcement learning based slam - safe navigational planner that learns to identify robot motions that can lead to failures in slam pose estimation and avoid such motions during trajectory planning . the method was expected to generate trajectories that have minimal failures and pose estimation errors over varying maps . through various experiments we have proven the effectiveness of a slam - safe planner that predicts failures and executes recovery actions to continue the navigation task . in terms of learning slam - safe behaviour , our method showed an increase in performance by about 50% as compared to supervised learning methods . in terms of slam recovery during trajectory planning , our methods showed about 70% improvement in comparison with a state - of - the - art trajectory planner and about 45% in comparison with supervised learning based planners . autonomous navigation with a monocular camera has always been challenging due to reasons mentioned earlier . this paper establishes that a rl framework is able to learn precisely those actions resorted by humans when they use a handheld camera or teleoperate a robot for slam . for example this involves slow transitions to newer scenes avoiding sharp turns by repeated back and forth motions , which was well captured by the learning framework . leung , cindy , shoudong huang , and gamini dissanayake . `` active slam using model predictive control and attractor based exploration .

SUMMARY:variations of the x - ray spectral slope have been found in many active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at moderate luminosities and redshifts , typically showing a `` softer when brighter '' behaviour . 
 however , similar studies are not usually performed for high - luminosity agns . 
 we present an analysis of the spectral variability based on a large sample of quasars in wide intervals of luminosity and redshift , measured at several different epochs , extracted from the fifth release of the xmm newton serendipitous source catalogue . 
 our analysis confirms a `` softer when brighter '' trend also for our sample , extending to high luminosity and redshift the general behaviour previously found . 
 these results can be understood in light of current spectral models , such as intrinsic variations of the x - ray primary radiation , or superposition with a constant reflection component .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: spectral lag is a common feature in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . the lag is defined as the difference in time of arrival of high and low energy photons and is considered positive when the high - energy photons arrive earlier than the low energy ones . norris et al . reported a correlation between spectral lag and the isotropic peak luminosity of grbs based on a limited sample  @xcite . subsequently , various authors have studied the lag - luminosity relation using arbitrary observer - frame energy bands of various instruments  @xcite . typically the spectral lag ( @xmath3 ) is extracted in two arbitrary energy bands in the observer - frame . however , because of the redshift ( z ) dependance of grbs , the two energy bands can correspond to multiple energy bands in the source - frame thus introducing a variable energy dependant factor , which is difficult to take into account . we avoid this difficulty by defining two energy bands ( @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev ) in the grb source - frame and projecting these two bands into the observer - frame using the relation @xmath4 . for our sample of grbs , after projecting to the observer - frame , the selected energy bands lie in the @xmath2 burst alert telescope ( bat )  @xcite energy range ( @xmath5 kev ; see fig . [ fig01 ] ) . then we extracted the spectral lags between these energy channels , correct them for cosmological time dilations using the relation , @xmath6 and plot them as a function of the isotropic peak luminosity . @xmath2 bat is a highly sensitive coded aperture instrument  @xcite . bat uses the modulation pattern resulting from the coded mask to facilitate background subtraction in the light curve and the spectral processing . this process is called mask weighting . we used the mask weighted , background - subtracted light curves , as well as non - mask weighted light curves in our analysis . the non - mask weighted light curves have about 30% better signal - to - noise ratio than the mask weighted light curves . hence , when the signal - to - noise ratio of mask weighted light curves was too small , non - mask weighted light curves were used to extract spectral lags . kev and @xmath1 kev are plotted against the isotropic peak luminosity . red data points indicate spectral lag values obtained from mask weighted light curves and blue indicate lag values extracted from non - mask weighted light curves.,width=453 ]    the spectral lags were extracted using improved cross - correlation function ( ccf ) analysis method described in reference  @xcite . in this method the spectral lag is extracted by finding the time delay corresponding to the global maximum of the ccf . a gaussian curve was fitted to the ccf to extract the spectral lag . the uncertainty in the spectral lag is obtained by simulating 1,000 light curves and repeating the aforementioned procedure . the standard deviation of the simulated spectral lag values is taken as the lag uncertainty . the isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , for each grb , is obtained by calculating the peak flux for the source - frame energy range , 1.0 kev to 10,000 kev , using the observed spectral - fit parameters and the luminosity distance as described in  @xcite . we used the sample of 31 grbs in reference  @xcite . however , some of the grbs in the sample did not have enough signal - to - noise to extract a spectral lag limiting the final sample to 22 grbs .    in our analysis , we have selected the grb source - frame energy bands @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev due to the energy range of @xmath2 bat and the redshift range of our sample . for mask weighted light curves , the effective energy range of the bat reduces to 15 - 200 kev , which implies a grb redshift range of 1 to 5.7 . however , for the non - mask weighted light curves we do nt have such a restriction and the full bat energy range ( @xmath5 kev ) can be utilized . in this case the redshift lower limit can be as low as 0.2 . our final sample of 22 grbs have redshift ranging from 0.54 to 5.46 .    in fig . [ fig02 ] , @xmath7 is plotted as a function of redshift corrected spectral lag . the spectral lag is anti - correlated with @xmath7 with a correlation coefficient of -0.76 @xmath8 0.06 . the index of the best - fit power - law is @xmath9 , which is shallower compared to observer - frame results from norris et al . 2000 @xcite ( @xmath10 ) and ukwatta et al . 2009 @xcite ( @xmath11 ) . we have investigated the spectral lag between @xmath12 kev and @xmath13 kev energy bands at the grb source - frame by projecting these bands to the observer - frame . this is a step forward in the investigation of lag - luminosity relation since all previous investigations used arbitrary observer - frame energy bands . the correlation coefficient of @xmath14 shows a significant improvement over the average correlation coefficient of @xmath15 reported in the reference @xcite .
SUMMARY:we have investigated the empirical lag - luminosity relation in the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) source - frame . 
 we selected two energy bands ( @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev ) in the grb source - frame , which after redshift correction , lie in the observer - frame energy range of the @xmath2 burst alert telescope ( bat ) . 
 the spectral lags between these energy channels are then presented as a function of the isotropic peak luminosity of the grbs in the sample .

TEXT: the output parameters of ` nbody6++ ` ( aarseth 1999 ) simulations are mostly theoretical values . to make a direct comparison between n - body simulation data and observations , we combine galev ( galaxy evolutionary synthesis models ; kotulla et al . 2009 ) , a flexible algorithm to combine astrophysical colors in many filters and spectra of stars ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) or sets of stars , with ` nbody6++ ` simulations . in this paper , we present the structure of this new code : galevnb ( galev for n - body simulations ) . adapting subroutines from galev , galevnb can produce spectra spans the range from far - uv at 90@xmath0 to far ir at 160@xmath2 m , with a spectral resolution of 20@xmath0 in the uv - optical and 50 - 100@xmath0 in the near ir range . given a list of requested filters in hst , eso , sdss , 2mass etc . , galevnb convolves the spectra with the filter response functions and applies the chosen zero - points ( vegamag , abmag , and stmag ) to yield absolute magnitudes . galevnb bridges theoretical parameters and their observed values , thus allows us to understand the color and spectra evolution of star clusters , and to determine the initial conditions and parameters of star cluster simulations with a direct comparison to observations . the main program of galevnb is ` galevnb.f90 ` , which parses single snapshot files ( stellar evolution only ) generated by ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` . it uses seven subroutines ( ` startomaginit ` , ` specint_initialize ` , ` reset_weights ` , ` startomag ` , ` add_star ` , ` spec2mag ` , ` spec_output ` ) of galev package to convert effective temperature , stellar luminosity , metallicity , and mass into observational magnitudes and spectra . the functions of these routines are presented in table 1 . the galevnb package contains four folders : 1 ) ` spectral_templates ` , in which locate all the spectral template files from the basel library of model atmospheres ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) ; 2 ) ` standard_filters ` , contains a large set of filter response functions ( fuv , nuv , u , b , v , r , i , j , h , k ) that are used as standard reference filters ; 3 ) ` filter_response_curves ` , includes filter response functions from magnitude systems of hst , eso instruments , 2mass , sdss , johnson , and cousins in separate subfolders . we also provide a choice of user - specify filter response functions . information about the entire set of available filters is included in the file ` filterlist.dat ` . please aware that ` filterlist.dat ` , in which the user specify their own choice of magnitude system by uncommenting the line of chosen filter , must be presented in the same directory as the ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` snapshot files . the content of the file , ` filterlist.dat ` , is presented in table 2 .    to compile galevnb , the user should have c++ and fortran installed . the input file of galevnb should be a sinlge snapshot output from ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` simulations . in case of a file containing all snapshots ( called ` sev.83 ` in ` nbody6++ ` and ` fort.83 ` in ` nbody6 ` ) , we provide the user with a shell script ` generate_snapshots.sh ` in the folder , ` scripts ` , for retrieving single snapshot data out of ` sev.83 ` and ` fort.83 ` . the user can select his / her preferred filters ( maximum 20 ) by uncommenting the row of the corresponding filter in ` filterlist.dat ` , and choose his / her desired magnitude system ( table 2 ) . magnitudes of individual stars and the whole cluster , and spectra of the cluster or chosen stellar types are produced , respectively . cc subroutine & function + ` specint_initialize ` & initialize the stellar spectra + ` reset_weights ` & reset the weight of stellar spectra + ` add_star ` & integrate the flux of all stars in the cluster + ` spec_output ` & output spectra + ` startomaginit ` & initialize the stellar magnitude + ` spec2mag ` & convolve the stellar spectra with the filter response function + ` startomag ` & compute magnitudes for stars +    ccc column & content & i d of zero point + 1 & filter name & + 2 & corresponding path of the filter response function & + 3 & i d of selected zero point ( default value is 1 ) & + 4 & standard zero point in the vega magnitude system & 1 + 5 & standard zero point in the ab magnitude system & 2 + 6 & standard zero point in the st magnitude system & 3 + 7 & optional user - defined zero point & 4 +

 galevnb is developed for the purpose of a direct comparison between n - body simulations and observations . 
 it converts the fundamental stellar properties of n - body simulations , i.e. , stellar mass , temperature , stellar luminosity and metallicity , into observational magnitudes for a variety of filters of widely used instruments / telescopes ( hst , eso , sdss , 2mass ) , and into spectra that span from far - uv ( 90 @xmath0 ) to near - ir ( 160 @xmath1 m ) .

TEXT: lal oscillations consist of periodic motions of the prominence threads along the magnetic field that are disturbed by a small energetic event close to the filament ( see luna et al . paper in this volume ) . luna and karpen ( 2012 ) argue that prominence oscillations can be modeled as a damped oscillating pendulum , whose equation of motion satisfies a zeroth - order bessel function . in their model , a nearby trigger event causes quasi - stationary preexisting prominence threads sitting in the dips of the magnetic structure to oscillate back and forth , with the restoring force being the projected gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate ( e.g. luna et al . ( 2012 ) ) . in this paper , we report preliminary results of comparisons of observations of prominence oscillations with the model presented by luna and karpen ( 2012 ) . more details will be available in the forthcoming paper by luna et al . ( 2013 ) .    in this analysis , we place slits along the filament spine and measure the intensity along each slit as a function of time . fig . [ figures ] ( left ) shows the filament in the aia 171  filter with the slits overlaid . each slit is then rotated in increments of 0.5@xmath0 from 0@xmath0 to 60@xmath0 with respect to the filament spine . we select the best slit according to the following criteria : ( a ) continuity of oscillations , ( b ) amplitude of the oscillation is maximized , ( c ) clear transition from dark to bright regions , ( d ) maximum number of cycles . [ figures ]    the oscillation for a representative slit is shown in figure [ figures ] ( right ) , which corresponds to the grey slit in figure [ figures ] ( left ) . we identify the position of the center of mass of the thread by finding the intensity minimum along the slit , indicated by black crosses in figure [ figures ] ( right ) . these points are then fit to equation ( 2.1 ) of luna et al . ( this volume ) , and the resulting fit is shown in white . fitting our data to equation ( 2.1 ) of luna et al . ( this volume ) yields values of @xmath1 ranging between 1 - 13 . using equation ( 2.2 ) of luna et al . ( this volume ) , we find the average radius of curvature of the magnetic field dips that support the oscillating threads . we find it to be approximately 60 mm . we also calculate a threshold value for the field itself that would allow it to support the observed threads . using equation ( 3.1 ) of luna et al . ( this volume ) , we find an average magnetic field of @xmath2 , assuming a typical filament number density of @xmath3 @xmath4 , in good agreement with measurements ( e.g. mackay et al . on average , the oscillations form an angle of @xmath5 with respect to the filament spine , and have a period of @xmath6 hours . to explain the very strong damping mass must accrete onto the threads at a rate of about 60 @xmath7 kg / hr . we conclude that the observed oscillations are along the magnetic field , which forms an angle of @xmath8@xmath9 with respect to the filament spine ( tandberg - hanssen & anzer , 1970 ) . we find that both the curvature and the magnitude of the magnetic field are approximately uniform on different threads . both the bessel and sinusoidal functions are well fitted , indicating that mass accretion is a likely damping mechanism of lal oscillations , and that the restoring force is the projected gravity in the dips where the threads oscillate . the mass accretion rate agrees with the theoretical value ( karpen et al . , 2006 , luna , karpen , & devore , 2012 ) .
SUMMARY:on 20 august 2010 an energetic disturbance triggered damped large - amplitude longitudinal ( lal ) oscillations in almost an entire filament . in the present work we analyze this periodic motion in the filament to characterize the damping and restoring mechanism of the oscillation . 
 our method involves placing slits along the axis of the filament at different angles with respect to the spine of the filament , finding the angle at which the oscillation is clearest , and fitting the resulting oscillation pattern to decaying sinusoidal and bessel functions . 
 these functions represent the equations of motion of a pendulum damped by mass accretion . with this method 
 we determine the period and the decaying time of the oscillation . 
 our preliminary results support the theory presented by luna and karpen ( 2012 ) that the restoring force of lal oscillations is solar gravity in the tubes where the threads oscillate , and the damping mechanism is the ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads . following an earlier paper , we have determined the magnitude and radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic flux tubes hosting a thread along the filament , as well as the mass accretion rate of the filament threads , via the fitted parameters .

TEXT: the two videos for numerical simulations of droplet(s ) breakup and coalescence are http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/8237/2/lifted_h2_emst_fuel.mpg[video1 ] and http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/8237/4/lifted_h2_iem_fuel.mpg[video2 ] .    in the link videos , the simulations are performed using a finite volume staggered mesh method coupled with moving mesh interface tracking ( mmit ) scheme to locate the interface @xcite . the advantages of this method is : 1 ) the interface is tracked by the triangular surfaces of the interior tetrahedral mesh elements , and thus zero - thickness ; 2 ) the jumps of the fluids properties and stresses across the interface are implemented directly without smoothing ; 3 ) the mass of each phase is naturally conserved due to the lagrangian motion of the interface . to capture the large deformations and wide range of length scales , a number of mesh adaptation schemes are implemented , and these mesh adaptation schemes distribute the mesh in an optimized way to achieve computing efficiency . the topological changes in multiphase flows are computed by the mesh separation and mesh combination schemes @xcite . three cases are shown in the videos . the first case is the simulation of the relaxation and breakup of an initially extended droplet . the initial drop has a shape with a cylinder in the center and two bulbous ends . the surface forces are not balanced and thus the droplet experience a contraction and for this case the droplet eventually breaks up to three satellited drops . the density and viscosity ratios are 10 , and 0.1 , respectively , and the ohnesorge number is 0.037 . the result was reported previously @xcite , however , for the current simulation , the smallest neck radius is 10 times smaller than the previous simulation . the second case is an off - center droplet pair collision , and due to the large initial momentum , the two droplets coalesce and finally break up into five satellite drops . this case has a weber number of 32 , a reynolds number of 80 , and both the density and viscosity ratios of 10 . the detail of the simulation can be found in @xcite . the third case is a droplet pair in a shear flow with matched densities of the two fluids , and a viscosity ratio of 1.4 , a reynolds number of 0.1 , and a capillary number of 0.14 . initially the droplets are 5@xmath1 ( @xmath1 is the radius of the spherical drop ) away from each other streamwisely , and have a separation of 0.5@xmath1 in the direction perpendicular to the free stream direction . the capability of our schemes in dealing with topological changes and resolving multiple length scales has been demonstrated .
SUMMARY:droplet(s ) breakup and coalescence have been simulated by the finite volume / moving mesh interface tracking method ( mmit ) with adaptive mesh refining and coarsening . in this method , 
 the interface is zero - thickness and moves in a lagrangian fashion . 
 the breakup and the coalescence of the interfaces are simulated by the mesh separation and mesh combination schemes . 
 three cases are displayed in this video , which include the relaxation and breakup of an initially extended droplet , two identical droplets off - center collision , and a droplet pair in a shear flow . 
 the mesh adaptation is capable of capturing large deformations and thin regions , and the smallest length resolved is three orders of magnitude smaller than the droplet radius . 
 the fluid dynamics videos of the simulations are to be presented in the gallery of fluid motion , @xmath0 .

TEXT: eclipsing binary systems provide a good opportunity for studying the presence of an unresolved third body by observing their minima times because of the light - time effect ( hereafter lite ) . it was explained by irwin and its necessary criteria have been mentioned by frieboes - conde & hertzeg and also by mayer . presence of the third body in the system is possible only if the times of minima behave in agreement with a theoretical lite curve , the resultant mass function has reasonable value and corresponding variations in radial velocities are measured . in the last decade also a confirmation by astrometry seems to be plausible .    in each case we have calculated new light elements of the eclipsing pair and also the parameters of the predicted third body orbit . the tables i. and ii . present results for each system , where @xmath0 are masses of components , @xmath1 computed period of the unresolved body , @xmath2 semiamplitude of lite , @xmath3 eccentricity , @xmath4 length of periastron , @xmath5 mass function and @xmath6 minimum mass ( for @xmath7 = 90@xmath8 ) of predicted body , respectively . the subscript 3 and 4 denotes the parameter of the third and fourth body , respectively . we have derived new linear light elements : + oo aql : @xmath9 + v338 her : @xmath10 + t lmi : @xmath11 + rv lyr : @xmath12 + tw lac : @xmath13 + v396 mon : @xmath14 + in the case of oo aql and t lmi also the hypothesis of the fourth body was suggested . the results are in table ii . in the system oo  aql the components are very similar and also similar to the sun ( sp . g5v , t @xmath15 5700 k ) , so the second order variations could also be caused by the the magnetic cycles , similar to the sun ( so - called applegate mechanism , see eg . applegate ) .    in the system v338 her also the quadratic term was applied , so the mass transfer in the system could be present . from this hypothesis ( with mass transfer parameter @xmath16 ) we have derived the mass transfer rate to @xmath17 .    in a few cases here the potential third body would be detectable in the detailed light curve analysis . especially the cases where the third body has not negligible mass , comparing with the eclipsing pair . regrettably we have no information about the distance of individual systems and also about the absolute magnitudes , so the determination of the angular separation of the possible third body is very uncertain . references : [ 1 ]  al - naimiy et.al . ; [ 2 ]  budding ; [ 3 ]  cester ; [ 4 ]  budding ; [ 5 ]  halbedel ; [ 6 ]  yang & liu . we have derived new lite parameters for six eclipsing binaries by means of an @xmath18 diagram analysis . in two cases , oo aql and t  lmi , another variation was found , so there is a possibility of a presence of the fourth body in the system , or magnetic activity in them . but we have not enough data to make a final decision . so the consequence is , that for the confirmation of presence of the lite in these systems , we need detailed photometric , spectroscopic or astrometric data of these binaries . this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services . this investigation was supported by the czech - greek project of collaboration rc-3 - 18 of ministry of education , youth and sport and by the grant agency of the czech republic , grant no .
SUMMARY:the period changes of six eclipsing binaries have been studied with focus on the light - time effect . with the least squares method we also calculated parameters of such effect and properties of the unresolved body in these systems . with these results we discussed probability of presence of such bodies in the systems with respect to possible confirmation by another method . in two systems we also suggested a hypothesis of fourth body or magnetic activity for explanation of the `` second - order variability '' after subtraction of the light - time effect of the third body .

[ cols=""<,^,^,^,^,<"",options=""header "" , ] let us represent generic halos , including the cdm ones , by means of : @xmath5 \   [ 1+(r / r_s)^{\alpha } ] ^{(\delta-\gamma)/\alpha}}\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density inner slope , @xmath7 is the outer slope and @xmath8 settles the turnover point between the inner and outer regimes . the parameter @xmath9 indicates the presence of a  constant density "" ( inner ) region ( cdr ) . if @xmath10 , as in collisionless cdm , the density diverges for @xmath11 . in the case of @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the size of the cdr , whose value is @xmath14 . according to the above notation , the moore density profile corresponds to ( @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath6)= ( 0 , 1.5 , 3 , 1.5 ) and the burkert salucci one to ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 ) @xcite . we test these mass models by means of the dark halos detected around galaxies of a sample of low luminosity late  type spirals . in these objects the dm distribution can be easily derived from the available high - quality _ optical _ rotation curves because the stellar and hi disks contribute very little to the gravitational potential so as the beam smearing effect , plaguing the hi rc s , is obviously absent . the sample includes 9 high  quality _ optical _ rc s that are smooth and symmetric and extend at least out to the optical edge @xmath15 . the characteristics of merit are the following : the spatial resolution is better than @xmath16 and the velocity _ rms _ is @xmath17 . the mass modeling is furthermore simplified in that in these spirals the gas contribution to @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) is modest @xcite and the stellar surface brightness is very well fit by a freeman disk . the mass model includes _ i ) _ a stellar exponential thin disk with free parameter @xmath20 i.e. the fractional disk contribution to the total circular velocity at @xmath21 , and _ ii ) _ a dark spherical halo , whose contribution to @xmath18 is obtained from ( 1 ) in that : @xmath22 . once we choose the scenario ( i.e. @xmath12 or @xmath23 ) , we are left with two free parameters , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , the characteristic density and radius . both get determined by adjusting the model to data as in @xcite . the cdm halo profiles fail : in no case they can reproduce ( with or without an exponential disk ) the observed rc s . this is shown in fig . 1 : the discrepancy with data is very high at any radius . the cdm halos , even allowed to take any value for @xmath13 ( or for the concentration parameter ) , have definitely a too steep density profile in the innermost region and show a too flat profile in the outer regions . next , we fit the bs profile to the data : the results are shown in fig . 1 and table 1 . this model fits perfectly , indicating the values of parameters which are reported in table 1 . each of 9 halos has a central density @xmath14 of about @xmath24 g/@xmath25 that keeps constant out the edge of the stellar distribution . we definitely conclude , as in @xcite , that the dark halos embedding the stellar disks show a density distribution inconsistent with that predicted by cdm ( see fig.2 ) . real halos in the universe rather resemble , in the regions where the stars reside , some homogeneous spheres . crucially , the sample and the method employed here level off to zero the criticisms raised to previous claims for dm core radii in galaxies . furthermore , since the dm radial distribution out to @xmath15 is featureless , we can not link together the local and the global properties of the dark halos ; such a connection , which is a main consequence of the bottom  up merging scenario appears to be just missing in nature . the cdm scenario , then , must find a way to cut off any signature of the gravitational collisionless collapse . for instance , the  temperature "" of the cdm particles , which initially @xmath26 for @xmath27 , must be largely heated up and kept constant out to the disk edge ( see @xcite ) . solving this deep mystery will be the guideline of our ( and others ) future research .
SUMMARY:high  quality optical rotation curves for a sample of low  luminosity spirals evidence that the dark halos around galaxies are inconsistent with the output of proper cdm simulations . 
 in fact , dark halos enveloping stellar disks are structures with approximately a constant density out to the optical edges .

TEXT: the creation of electron - positron pairs through strong fields , which as been predicted theoretically by f. sauter as early as 1931 @xcite but not yet been observed , is nowadays of high interest for both laboratory scientists and astrophysicists @xcite . the obstacle to be solved is the creation of a sufficiently strong electric field . in this note we will present an approach to investigate the dynamic response of an ultra - relativistic compressed electron gas subjected to the breathing mode of the underlying nucleus , a system that promises to generate strong electric fields , depending on the mutual dynamics of negative and positive charges . this model can , with slight modification like an adjustment of proton density , be extrapolated to astrophysical scales . in @xcite we presented the stationary solutions of pulsating electron gas in the framework of the thomas - fermi model , and we will now recapitulate the main results that are of importance for the present work . in this model the nucleus is modeled as a sphere of homogenous positive charge distribution . the electrons are considered a charged perfect fluid with the equation of state of a fermi gas at zero temperature . since we want to treat the regime around nuclear density we can assume the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath0 for the equation of state , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are energy density , pressure , and number density respectively of the electron gas . throughout the text , natural units @xmath4 , @xmath5 are used . when we assume the nucleus of proton number @xmath6 to have a radius @xmath7 in units of the pion mass , and provide sufficient external pressure to restrain the electrons to the volume of the nucleus , we obtain the very simple equilibrium configuration @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 measures the departure of proton density from nuclear densities . positive and negative charges completely cancel , so there is no electric field in equilibrium . introducing a time - dependent displacement field @xmath10 and treating euler s and maxwell s equations to first order , one obtains for stationary modes the second order ordinary differential equation @xmath11\xi(r)=0.\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath13 is the frequency of the mode that has to be choosen according to approriate boundary conditions . this leads to @xmath14^{1/2 }    \ \ \ \mathrm{and}\ \ \ \ \xi_n(x)={\mathcal c}\,j_{1}\left(\pi n\,r / r_\mathrm{nuc}\right),\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath15 is an arbitrary factor and @xmath16 is the first member of the spherical bessel functions of first kind . the first member of the spherical bessel functions of first kind @xmath16 allows to construct an orthonormal basis ( see figure [ fig : basisplot ] ) @xmath17 on the interval @xmath18 $ ] with respect to the scalar product @xmath19 to model a driving force acting on the system we can expand the dirac delta function on the surface @xmath20 and the identity function @xmath21 in terms of this basis . the spatial delta function at the surface can be used in combination with a temporal delta function to model an instantaneous impulse applied to the surface , or in combination with a harmonic temporal function to drive the surface periodically . the identity function in combination with a harmonic temporal function models the breathing mode of a homogenously charged sphere . to first order , gauss law predicts an electric force proportional to the radius resulting from any contraction or expansion of the sphere . according to ( [ diffeqn ] ) and ( [ omegan ] ) the basis functions fulfil the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a differential operator in @xmath24 . making the ansatz @xmath25 and plugging it into the equation of motion subject to an external force @xmath26 we can expand in the basis @xmath27 to obtain the independent equations @xmath28 where @xmath29 if the force is applied just for an instant at @xmath30 we can write @xmath31 , and assuming the system initially unperturbed ( @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) the solution to ( [ eqnsom ] ) is @xmath34 if the force is applied at a frequency @xmath35 starting at @xmath30 we can write @xmath36 , and assuming the system initially unperturbed the solution to ( [ eqnsom ] ) is @xmath37 using for @xmath38 now the coefficients of ( [ deltaexpand ] ) or ( [ idexpand ] ) , we can construct various dynamical situtations in the compressed atom . using the formalism developed above , it is now possible to investigate the response of the electron gas to the nuclear breathing mode for different system sizes from atoms and giant atoms to neutron stars . the proton density should be determined from beta - equilibrium , while the frequency of the breathing mode has to be inferred from studies of nuclear incompressibility such as @xcite . an investigation has to take into account the energy budget of the intitial breathing mode , comparing it to the energy transferred to electron gas and electric field , to determine if dampening of the former occurs first . we thank the national academy of sciences of belarus for their hospitality . h. ludwig is supported by the erasmus mundus joint doctorate program by grant number 2012 -

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: dispersion measure quantifies the integrated dispersive effect of the plasma between the pulsar and the observing telescope , on the propagating broadband pulsar signal . in general , it varies with time due to reasons such as the transverse motion of pulsar sampling different lines of sight ( los ) through inhomogeneous and turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) , solar wind and solar corona , plasma density changes in the binary orbit and drifting wisps of ionized gas in supernova shell . for pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) , which aim for a final accuracy of 100 @xmath1 or better at l band , dm variations as small as @xmath2 need to be corrected for . meanwhile , the timing accuracies currently achieved for most of the ppta pulsars are still of the order of a @xmath3 and above ( @xcite ) and therefore dm corrections could improve these . as indicated from the observations by @xcite , @xcite , later from analytical derivation , for a turbulent ism , @xmath4 , which implies significant change over a period of a few days to a week for a typical dm of a few tens of @xmath5 . the gmrt , using its low frequency capability , can provide more accurate dm measurements by taking advantage of the inverse - square law dependency of the delay on the observing frequency , as has been demonstrated by @xcite , who had achieved an accuracy of up to @xmath6 for long period pulsars . a program was initiated at the gmrt , in nov 2009 , to carry out roughly bi - weekly simultaneous dual - frequency observations at 325 and 610 mhz for 11 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , primarily to track the dm variations accurately and study their effects on timing accuracy as well as for studying dm variations due to the solar corona and the solar wind . the observations used the gmrt software back - end ( @xcite ) in the simultaneous dual - frequency phased array mode , giving total intensity time - series from 512 channels over 32 mhz of bandwidth at each frequency . in this mode the data streams from the two frequencies are locked to each other without any instrumental delay , allowing accurate dm estimates without requiring absolute timing measurements . the data were incoherently dedispersed and folded using a doppler corrected period . the delay was computed using the peak of the cross - correlation between the profiles at the two frequencies . the dm was computed as @xmath7 , where k , called dispersion constant , is equal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the total delay , as seen at the solar system barycenter , between the signals at the two frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 . errors were estimated by propagating the off - pulse noise of the two profiles to estimate the rms error of the measured delay . significant dm variations are detected ( table [ tab1 ] ) for all the pulsars , with accuracies of @xmath0 achieved for most of them . for most pulsars , the rms dm variation is comparable to that seen in the ppta data and also to the reported value from @xcite . the dm variations seem to show significant correlation with the parkes data for four msps ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . .summary of the dm measurements for nine of the msps . the catalogue period is in @xmath12 , dm@xmath13 and @xmath14 are in @xmath15 . rms@xmath16 and @xmath17 are in @xmath18 . the last four columns give the mean of dm , rms of dm , the mean absolute error of dm over all the epochs and the equivalent toa error at l band ( corresponding to the rms ) in @xmath19s . [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]         the effects of solar corona are clearly detected in the case of low ecliptic latitude pulsars ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , even though many of our data points , up to 25@xmath20 from the sun , seem to disagree with the predictions based on the two - state solar wind model of @xcite , indicating possibilities for further refinements of the model including effects of special events like coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . two - state jumps in psr j1022 + 1001 s dm variation ( figure [ fig3 ] ) are found to be due to small , but quite well defined profile shape changes , akin to the well known mode changing phenomenon seen in some pulsars . further comparisons and studies ( e.g. ism structure function analysis ) will be possible in future as our data extend to longer time spans .
SUMMARY:we present the results from nearly three years of monitoring of the variations in dispersion measure ( dm ) along the line - of - sight to 11 millisecond pulsars using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . 
 these results demonstrate accuracies of single epoch dm estimates of the order of @xmath0 . 
 a preliminary comparison with the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) data shows that the measured dm fluctuations are comparable . 
 we show effects of dm variations due to the solar wind and solar corona and compare with the existing models .

 phase dependent changes in the wind lines have been observed , indicating the creation of a x - ray ionization zone in the stellar wind . 
 the high x - ray luminosity of smc x-1 ionizes much of the wind and leaves a stromgren zone . 
 this disrupts the resonance - line acceleration of the wind in portions of the orbit , quencing the wind and disrupting the mass flow . 
 a similar but less dramatic effect was found for the first time in 4u1700 - 37 . 
 this so - called hatchett - mccray ( hm ) effect had been predicted for 4u1700 - 37 , but was not previously detected .

TEXT: cygnus x3 is a unique and poorly understood x - ray source which may represent a very short - lived , transitional state of binary evolution . a study of its dynamics ( via the orbital ephemeris ) , and local environment ( via the light curve and spectrum ) may have broad implications for x - ray binaries in general . the period ( 4.8 hr , presumably orbital ) is characteristic of low mass x - ray binaries . however , there is evidence that the companion is actually a high - mass wolf - rayet star @xcite . the mass loss from the stellar wind of such a star could explain the large _ positive _ @xmath1 measured in cyg x3 , which is inconsistent with mass transfer via roche lobe overflow @xcite . the light curve , observed in ir and x - rays , is asymmetric with a non - zero eclipse , resulting , in most models , from interactions in a dense cocoon or wind around the system @xcite . if the asymmetry is instead caused by an elliptical orbit , the light curve shape is expected to change significantly over time due to apsidal motion @xcite which could also produce some or all of the apparent period increase @xcite . therefore , measurements of the light curve shape are directly related to the orbital dynamics . osse @xcite observed cyg x-3 for @xmath2 days in 7 intervals between 1991 may 30 and 1994 july 12 . we use the 2-min background - subtracted @xmath3  to 10  spectra produced by the standard osse spectral analysis routines for these 7 observations . there was no significant flux contribution from cyg x1 in any of the source or background pointings . some results of the earlier osse observations have been described elsewhere @xcite .    for the asm we used the background subtracted 210  cyg x-3 counting rates from the quick - look results provided by the asm / rxte team over the www . the data analyzed here cover 1996 feb 22  1997 apr 11 . .asm arrival times [ cols=""^,^,^,^ "" , ] the asm arrival times were combined with those from earlier soft x - ray observations and fit with both quadratic and cubic ephemeris models ( figure [ res_plot ] ) . the resulting best - fit parameters are shown in table [ ephem ] . neither quadratic nor cubic models provide a statistically acceptable fit to all the data . possibly the errors in earlier data have been underestimated due to cycle - to - cycle variations or other systematic effects @xcite . no single data set drives the bad @xmath4 . the cubic term is still statistically significant , but the fitted magnitude has decreased with time : from @xmath5 @xcite to @xmath6 yr@xmath7 in this work . the wind model predicts essentially zero @xmath8 . future asm data should provide a definitive test of the reality of the non - zero @xmath8 . following the same procedure used for the asm data , arrival times were determined for the each of the 7 osse observations of cyg x3 from 1991 to 1994 using light curves of 2-min background - subtracted counting rates @xmath0130 . the arrival times for the 7 observations were compared with the values predicted using the soft x - ray ephemerides ( table [ ephem ] ) . the osse points fall systematically below the predicted curves on the residual plot . the osse phase minimum ( @xmath0130 ) is significantly ( 67@xmath9 ) earlier than the predicted soft x - ray ( 110 ) minimum for both quadratic and cubic ephemerides ( @xmath10 min , @xmath11 ) . the data are consistent with a constant offset over more than 3 years of observations . light curves ( figure [ lc ] ) were produced from the asm and osse data using the quadratic ephemeris in table [ ephem ] . the plotted errors in the asm data reflect only the reported statistical errors . the light curves were fit with the exosat soft x - ray template @xcite , varying phase , amplitude , and dc intensity to determine the phase of minimum and the consistency of the overall shape with the template . both the osse and asm light curves are statistically _ inconsistent _ with the canonical x - ray template @xcite . qualitatively , however , the template reasonably describes the asm data . the large @xmath12 is due to the fact that the actual observed variations in each bin are larger that the statistical errors due to underlying source fluctuations . the osse lc appears somewhat more symmetric than the template , with a faster rise , but this is difficult to constrain with current data . the differences in lc shape may contribute to the apparent phase shift with energy . matz , s.  m. , grabelsky , d.  a. , purcell , w.  r. , ulmer , m.  p. , johnson , w.  n. , kinzer , r.  l. , kurfess , j.  d. , and strickman , m.  s. , in _ the evolution of x - ray binaries ( aip conf . 308 ) , _ holt , s.  s. and day , c.  s. , editors , 263 ( aip , new york , 1994 ) .
SUMMARY:the orbital dynamics of cyg x-3 are a key to understanding this enigmatic x - ray binary . 
 recent observations by the rxte asm and the osse instrument on gro enable us to extend the baseline of arrival time measurements and test earlier models of orbital period evolution . 
 we derive new quadratic and cubic ephemerides from the soft x - ray data ( including asm ) . 
 we find a significant shift between the predicted soft x - ray phase and the light curve phase measured by osse from @xmath0 to 130 . some of the apparent phase shift may be caused by a difference in light curve shape .

TEXT: nearly all galaxy bulges contain supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , so galaxy assembly by hierarchical merging should produce wide pairs of slowly inspiraling smbhs that either `` stall '' as tight binaries with 1  pc separation or merge and are kicked away from the galaxy nucleus by anisotropic gravitational radiation . we have begun a systematic vlba search for off - nuclear inspiraling or recoiling smbhs and for tight smbh pairs in a complete sample of 923 nearby ( d @xmath0 mpc ) 2mass galaxies containing nvss radio sources stronger than 100  mjy . this survey simultaneously addresses three scientific problems : ( 1 )  smbh / galaxy co - evolution implied by the smbh / bulge mass correlation , ( 2 )  the `` merger tree '' theory of smbh evolution , and ( 3 )  the expected contribution of merging smbh binaries to the gravitational - wave background sought by lisa and the nanograv pulsar timing experiment . we search for offset or multiple smbhs in a large complete sample by observing radio sources with the vlba at 8  ghz ( x band ) to ( 1 )  filter out extended emission from kiloparsec - scale radio jets and compact starbursts whose brightness temperatures never exceed @xmath1  k @xcite ; ( 2 ) resolve stalled smbh binaries ; and ( 3 )  favor compact flat - spectrum cores located very close to the smbhs over extended steep - spectrum emission . our complete sample of nearby stellar bulges begins with all 2mass galaxies brighter than @xmath2 at @xmath3 m , the wavelength at which luminosity is a good tracer of total stellar mass . the typical distance to these galaxies is 200 mpc .    for our smbh tracer , we use the compact cores of the 923 nvss sources stronger than 100  mjy at 1.4  ghz identified with these 2mass galaxies . among them , 89 were observed in prior experiments . the luminosity of a 100  mjy source at @xmath4  mpc is only @xmath5  w hz@xmath6 , but 90% of these galaxies are radio - loud compared with the fir / radio correlation of star - forming galaxies , so they almost certainly contain agns . each target source is observed in two scans at 8 intermediate frequencies spread over 7.908.89  ghz . observations are made with phase calibrators in the c t  c mode with @xmath7  s on a calibrator and 320  s on a target in each scan . observing sessions are scheduled by the vlba array operator using an automatic algorithm at the lowest priority during periods of time when no other experiments can run due to various constraints . observations of individual calibrator / target pairs are scheduled in the so - called absolute astrometry mode with a set of four different atmosphere calibrator sources observed every 1.5  hours . this hybrid observing mode allows us to process the data both as absolute astrometry experiments using wide - band group delays determined with the wide - band baseline fringe fitting algorithm  @xcite and as differential astrometry experiments .    by october 2011 , 328  hours of observing time were allotted . in total , 733 of the 834 sources were observed , and among them 401 were detected in the baseline mode . the baseline detection limit is 69  mjy , depending on the weather . the distribution of the correlated flux densities is shown in figure  [ f : flux ] . _ left : _ the distribution of correlated flux densities of unresolved radio components in our sample of galaxies . the units for flux densities are jansky . the straight fitting line has slope @xmath8 . _ right : _ the offsets of the radio cores from the ir positions . the circle with radius @xmath9 corresponds to the 99.9% confidence level of a source offset due to random errors of the 2mass catalogue.,scaledwidth=61.0% ]    the median accuracy of vlbi positions is 0.6 mas . the differences between the 2mass and vlbi positions have rms scatter @xmath10  mas consistent with the 2mass position accuracy , and the systematic right ascension and declination offsets are less than 10  mas . of 490 detected sources , 12 have offsets exceeding 500  mas ( not shown in the plot ) . among them , 5 sources are considered as good candidates for offset black holes to be investigated in depth in follow - up multi - frequency observations . the results of anaysis of processed vlba experiments are accessible from the project web page .
SUMMARY:we are using the vlba at 8  ghz to observe a sample of 834 nearby 2mass galaxies that are stronger than 100  mjy in the nvss .

TEXT: this paper documents some of the dynamics observed when a gas is injected into a shallow pool of liquid . these dynamics are visible to the naked eye , but benefit from the high - frame rate and low exposure time offered by a high - speed camera . the high - speed video discussed in this paper is available in the accompanying http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/11469/3/bird_dfd2008_mpeg1.mpg[movie ] , submitted to the 2008 american physical societies division of fluid dynamic s gallery of fluid motion . the experimental setup consists of a 7 gauge metal needle placed into a 5-millimeter deep pool of 10 cst silicon oil , such that part of the needle tip contacts the bottom of the container . similar regimes have been observed in other liquids , although the dynamics are less crisp . helium is pumped through the needle at a modest flowrate of 3 ml / s . the advantage of helium is that it is well - characterized , inert , and readily available ; we suspect that the dynamics shown in the movie are independent of the gas properties . the flow of helium into the silicon oil distorts the interface between the silicon oil and surrounding air . the precise dynamics of this deformation depend on the angle of needle , flowrate of the gas , and the depth and material properties of the liquid . in this study we have held the flowrate and pool depth constant while varying the angle of the needle , @xmath0 . at low needle angles ( @xmath1 ) , the air - silicon oil interface is in static equilibrium . once the angle approaches @xmath2 , ripples propagate across the surface . due to the size and speed of the ripples , we believe that they are capillary waves , that is waves that are regulated by surface tension . as the angle of the needle continues to increase , the amplitude of the capillary waves grows such that an oscillating bulge develops . at higher angles , the bulge becomes both larger and more focused , developing into periodic jets . once the jet aspect ratio of the jet becomes sufficiently small ( @xmath3 ) , the tip of the jet pinches off to form a spherical droplet . the droplets formed from the periodic jets float over the interface , similarly to how drops avoid coalescence over a vibrating fluid @xcite . it is worthwhile to note that the droplets often coalesce with each other before coalescing with the interface , implying that it is unlikely that natural surfactants are responsible for the floating behavior . as the angle of the needle increases , the height of the upward jets increase . at sufficient jet height ( @xmath4 ) , the jets break into two drops , leading to both a high parabolic arch and a lower droplet stream . between ( @xmath5 ) , the jet dynamics breakdown so that the droplet streams appear chaotic . large bubbles sporadically form at the fluid interface , often with jets emitting from the bubble surface . droplets are still emitted from the jets , but the resulting bubble streams are incoherent . we have found that injecting gas into shallow liquid can lead to a rich variety of interfacial dynamics . by sweeping the angle of the gas - injecting needle , we observe a smooth transition between static deformation , juggling and tumbling of droplet streams , and an incoherent mix of bubbles and jets , reminiscent of a daredevil shooting out of a canon . this combination of dynamics provides an aesthetically pleasing show of liquid acrobatics .max_lengthrequest_suffix","this paper presents high - speed video observations of the dynamics of a gas injected into a shallow pool of liquid . the experiments show a variety of interfacial dynamics , including capillary waves , oscillating bulges , periodic jets , and chaotic droplet streams . the results are relevant to the study of fluid dynamics and the behavior of multiphase flows .","we experiment with injecting a continuous stream of gas into a shallow liquid , similar to how one might blow into a straw placed at the bottom of a near - empty drink . by varying the angle of the straw ( here a metal needle ) 
 , we observe a variety of dynamics , which we film using a high - speed camera . 
 most noteworthy is an intermediate regime in which cyclical jets erupt from the air - liquid interface and breakup into air - born droplets . 
 these droplets trace out a parabolic trajectory and bounce on the air - liquid interface before eventually coalescing . 
 the shape of each jet , as well as the time between jets , is remarkably similar and leads to droplets with nearly identical trajectories . 
 the following article accompanies the linked fluid dynamics video ( http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/11469/3/bird_dfd2008_mpeg1.mpg[low resolution ] , http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/11469/2/bird_dfd2008_mpeg2.mpg[high resolution ] ) submitted to the gallery of fluid motion in 2008 .",0.308,0.091,0.19," this paper documents some of the dynamics observed when a gas is injected into a shallow pool of liquid . these dynamics are visible to the naked eye , but benefit from the high - frame rate and low exposure time offered by a high - speed camera . the high - speed video discussed in this paper is available in the accompanying http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/11469/3/bird_dfd2008_mpeg1.mpg[movie ] , submitted to the 2008 american physical societies division of fluid dynamic s gallery of fluid motion . the experimental setup consists of a 7 gauge metal needle placed into a 5-millimeter deep pool of 10 cst silicon oil , such that part of the needle tip contacts the bottom of the container . similar regimes have been observed in other liquids , although the dynamics are less crisp . helium is pumped through the needle at a modest flowrate of 3 ml / s . the advantage of helium is that it is well - characterized , inert , and readily available ; we suspect that the dynamics shown in the movie are independent of the gas properties . the flow of helium into the silicon oil distorts the interface between the silicon oil and surrounding air . the precise dynamics of this deformation depend on the angle of needle , flowrate of the gas , and the depth and material properties of the liquid . in this study we have held the flowrate and pool depth constant while varying the angle of the needle , @xmath0 . at low needle angles ( @xmath1 ) , the air - silicon oil interface is in static equilibrium . once the angle approaches @xmath2 , ripples propagate across the surface . due to the size and speed of the ripples , we believe that they are capillary waves , that is waves that are regulated by surface tension . as the angle of the needle continues to increase , the amplitude of the capillary waves grows such that an oscillating bulge develops . at higher angles , the bulge becomes both larger and more focused , developing into periodic jets . once the jet aspect ratio of the jet becomes sufficiently small ( @xmath3 ) , the tip of the jet pinches off to form a spherical droplet . the droplets formed from the periodic jets float over the interface , similarly to how drops avoid coalescence over a vibrating fluid @xcite . it is worthwhile to note that the droplets often coalesce with each other before coalescing with the interface , implying that it is unlikely that natural surfactants are responsible for the floating behavior . as the angle of the needle increases , the height of the upward jets increase . at sufficient jet height ( @xmath4 ) , the jets break into two drops , leading to both a high parabolic arch and a lower droplet stream . between ( @xmath5 ) , the jet dynamics breakdown so that the droplet streams appear chaotic . large bubbles sporadically form at the fluid interface , often with jets emitting from the bubble surface . droplets are still emitted from the jets , but the resulting bubble streams are incoherent . we have found that injecting gas into shallow liquid can lead to a rich variety of interfacial dynamics . by sweeping the angle of the gas - injecting needle , we observe a smooth transition between static deformation , juggling and tumbling of droplet streams , and an incoherent mix of bubbles and jets , reminiscent of a daredevil shooting out of a canon . this combination of dynamics provides an aesthetically pleasing show of liquid acrobatics .max_lengthrequest_suffix"

TEXT: since one can not study directly how a galaxy forms and evolves ( how the mass and luminosity of a galaxy change with time ) , it becomes necessary to analyse the statistics of a large number of galaxies at different epochs . using the swire ( lonsdale et al . 2004 ) 24 m mips - band , one is able observe the fir emission from dust , tracing star - formation ( sf ) regions and sf - galaxies . by studying these galaxies at different epochs one can gain an estimate of the star formation history of the universe . as a follow up to swire , a spectroscopic redshift survey covering a 0.55 deg@xmath3 region , centred in the lockman validation field was undertaken . the sample was observed using the hydra spectrometer on the 4-m wiyn telescope at kpno and included 24 m sources down to a vega r - band magnitude of @xmath0 . a total of 286 24 m sources were observed and redshifts for the resultant spectra were determined . redshifts for 170 sources with 24 m fluxes down to a flux limit of 260jy were determined , giving a spectroscopic completeness for the sample of 82.5% . in order to determine each object s 24 m luminosity ( l@xmath4 ) an appropriate sed and k - correction for that galaxy must be chosen . here 6 seds were chosen , 2 agn , 2 spiral and 2 starburst ( xu et al . , 2001 ) . the fitting was performed using a minimum @xmath5 technique that incorporated an error weighting ( including a dispersion factor , previously unseen in the literature ) . this dispersion factor accounts for the scatter within a particular population of galaxies in colour - colour space . each sed was then convolved through the 24 m filter . the lf@xmath4 was estimated by implementing the 1/vmax estimator technique ( schmidt 1968 ) and took into account both the r - band and 24 m flux limits . a redshift split at @xmath2 was imposed , allowing evolution in the sample to be investigated , see fig.1 . the high - z sample ( pale line ) is composed of 38% of the total z - sample with v / vmax=0.72@xmath60.04 , showing strong evidence for luminosity evolution . the low - z sample ( dark line ) is composed of 62% of the total z - sample with v / vmax=0.46@xmath60.03 . note : incompleteness corrections need to be applied to the faintest luminosity bins of the high - z sample . parameterization of the swire lf was performed and a comparison with low - z from iras was made . using mcmc ( kashyap 1998 ) & mle ( sandage , et al . 1979 ) techniques to fit saunders et al . 1990 parametric form of the lf , the best fitting mcmc and mle model fits to the swire lf@xmath4 are shown in fig.2 . a direct comparison to shupe et al . 1998 lf@xmath7 is also shown in fig.2 . since this is an apriori model and not a fit it provides a fairly good description of our data . kashyap et al . 1998 , aspc , 154 , 844 ................... schmidt.m 1968 , apj , 151 , 393 lonsdale et al . 2004 , apj , 1 , 54 .......................... shupe et al . 1998 , apj , 501 , 597 sandage , et al . 1979 , apj , 232 , 352 ......................... xu et al . 2001 , apj , 562 , 179 saunders et al . 1990 , mnras , 242 , 318
SUMMARY:a spectroscopic follow - up of swire sources from the lockman validation field has allowed the determination of the swire / wiyn 24 m luminosity function ( lf ) . 
 the spectroscopic sample was chosen above a 24 m flux limit at 260jy and an r - band optical limit of @xmath0 . 
 a spectroscopic completeness of 82.5% was achieved . 
 we found the median redshift for the sample to be @xmath1 . 
 markov - chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) and maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) techniques were employed to fit a parametric lf . 
 our result of the local lf ( llf ) is consistent with the local 25 m determination from shupe et al .(1998 ) . 
 we split the sample at a redshift of @xmath2 and find strong evidence for galaxy evolution .

15,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: neural networks represent a multidisciplinary field , including e.g. neuroscience , mathematics , statistics , computer science , engineering , and physics . we can generally look at the development of the artificial neural network ( ann ) field as few periods of extensive research , starting with the first idea of a neuron by w.  mcculloch and w.  pitts ( 1943 ) @xcite . in the @xmath0 , j.  hopfield introduced his recurrent neural network , while p.  werbos developed the back - propagation algorithm - one of the most widely used to this day @xcite , @xcite . the reader should note that all developed networks are based on deterministic approach . anns try to mimic only the four fundamental elements of the biological neurons - input , processing , learning and output . in order to be able to generate an output , they exploit the interconnection principle between biological neurons . we can broadly classify them by the type of learning : supervised or unsupervised . through the learning ( or training process ) , the weights and biases of the network are adapted . there are many strategies for learning , usually determined by the way the values are evolved . the main important characteristics of the learning process are represented by two concurring passages , i.e. the capacity to use minimum computational resources , and to provide robustness of the system . one further step remains the choice of the error function , or target function and the goal is to minimize the error by varying the weights of the ann . nowadays in the standard approach , the changes in the weights are usually accomplished during the training process , with particularly nothing being implemented in the utilization of the network . among the possible options used in the learning process , the gradient descent method is one of the most common . the back - propagation algorithm proposed in @xcite uses the error to propagate it through the network layer by layer until an outcome is produced . the backpropagation looks for the minimum value of the error function in weight space through delta rule or gradient descent . on the other hand we have evolutionary algorithms , which are generally directed random searches . they start from a set of random population , slowly converging to a solution @xcite . another interesting alternative is represented by simulated annealing @xcite , which in some situation can perform faster than backpropagation or genetic algorithms . by analogy with the physics problem discussed in @xcite , the strategy is based on the transition process of a solid substance from increased temperature to thermal equilibrium . in this context , the cooling of a substance becomes equivalent to minimize the cost function of an optimization problem . in @xcite the simulated annealing method is achieved by substituting the cost for energy , and executing the algorithm by slowly decreasing the temperature values .    to the best of our knowledge , the above concepts are strongly based on analogies with classical ( or deterministic ) physics . an interesting possibility is to exploit , in some sense , quantum mechanical effects in a ann . this was suggested for the first time in @xcite where biological aspects of quantum phenomena in brain activity related to the activation point by a nerve impulse are described .    in this article , the action potential plays a fundamental role in information processing inside the brain . the authors suggested that the firing of a neuron is obtained by the motion of a quantum particle , in the proximity of a potential ( or energetic ) barrier where typically effects such as tunnelling occurs . alternatives to this explanation exist such as the one proposed in @xcite based on the concept of micro - tubules which are able to maintain a macroscopic coherent superposition . in particular , the suggested explanation described in @xcite inspired us to develop a technique which mimics quantum effects in order to improve the set of weights of a ann in the _ post - learning _ stage . in more details , our method aims to reinforce the reliability of a network even in the case of training failure , at a relatively low computational cost . the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we introduce the methodology behind the development of our proposed network . then , in order to validate this novel approach , we perform a set of numerical experiments involved in the problem of approximating a known function . in spite of the simplicity of the proposed technique , we believe that it provides a further chance for the network to escape from local minima , local optima or saddle points @xcite at a reasonable computational burden . nowadays , neural networks come in a great variety of ways - classification , data analysis , dimensionality reduction , etc , and thus there are many different implementations of neural networks . among them we have , for example , the perceptron @xcite , the multilayer feedforward network @xcite , the probabilistic network @xcite . interesting alternative based on fuzzy logic can be found in @xcite,@xcite . in this work , we focus on multilayer feedforward network , which consist of many neurons , each of them fully connected to every neuron in adjacent forward layers , although the technique is not limited to this particular implementation .
SUMMARY:today artificial neural networks are applied in various fields - engineering , data analysis , robotics . while they represent a successful tool for a variety of relevant applications , mathematically speaking they are still far from being conclusive . in particular , they suffer from being unable to find the best configuration possible during the training process ( local minimum problem ) . in this paper , we focus on this issue and suggest a simple , but effective , post - learning strategy to allow the search for improved set of weights at a relatively small extra computational cost . therefore , we introduce a novel technique based on analogy with quantum effects occurring in nature as a way to improve ( and sometimes overcome ) this problem . 
 several numerical experiments are presented to validate the approach .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: first of all , when evaluating the performance of an optimization strategy the class of optimization problems at hand play a very crucial part . in 1997 wolpert and macready @xcite published the no free lunch theorems for optimization. the theorems proof that for any algorithm , any elevated performance over one class of problem is exactly paid for in bad performance over another class . in other words , it does not exist no better nor worse optimization algorithm with respect to its average performance on all possible classes of problems . in ref . @xcite , smajic _ et al . _ analyze the performance of four different global search strategies by optimizing a power divider coded by 12 binary parameters . the 12 parameters give rise to a total of 4096 possible configuration . the relatively small size of the problem was chosen to keep the search space tractable , and by doing so , they limit themself to a specific class of problems . if this is not done carefully this class might be inadequately represented in a global perspective and the method will lack generalization . as a counter example the problem of optimizing a doped pc lens has been chosen . the number of lattice sites has been increased to 182 , which results in a considerable increase in the size of the search space . now a problem with @xmath0 possible configurations has to be processed . because of the immense number of solutions it is impossible to do a brute - force evaluation of all these configurations making the optimization process indispensable . please refer to ref . @xcite for any further details about this specific problem . to design the lens structure a design tool based on a multiple scattering theory @xcite , as a direct solver , and a genetic algorithm ( ga ) @xcite for global optimization , was implemented . this approach is similar to one of the four global search algorithms analyzed in section 4 of ref . the authors of ref . @xcite was `` disillusioned '' by the poor performance of the standard ga for solving a 12 bit - parameters problem of designing a power divider implementing the ga with a population of 45 individuals . as a countermeasure they used a micro - ga that works with multiple runs of a standard ga implemented with a much smaller population . in this way they improved the performance of the optimization process considerably . here we have repeated the some of the steps taken by smajic _ et al . _ and shown that there conclusions lack the generality of the concept `` _ _ optimization of photonic crystal structures _ _ '' .    figure [ fig:4graphs ] picture the performance of different gas implemented to optimize the 182 bit - parameters lens problem . the gas are implemented with different population sizes . figure [ fig:4graphs]a and b correspond to the so called micro - ga with population sizes of 5 and 20 , respectively , while fig . [ fig:4graphs]c and d correspond to normal ga optimizations with populations of 100 and 200 respectively . each optimization was carried out five times to get an idea of their stochastic behavior and each run was stopped after 50000 evaluations . it is clearly demonstrated that for this particular problem , a so called micro - ga ( fig [ fig:4graphs]a and b ) performs bad and a standard ga with a large population ( fig [ fig:4graphs]b and c ) is considerable more robust and effective . these results contradict the conclusions drawn in ref . @xcite from the 12-bit power divider design problem . in summary , the optimization or inverse - design of photonic crystal structures is an challenging problem . to find a global search algorithm for solving the wide class of problems consisting in effective design of pc devices is a difficult task that has to be tackled with rigor . to analyze the performance in a generic way of any proposed scheme of optimization it is important to choose a general problem or even to solve a set of problems . in our opinion , this has not been done in ref . @xcite and , therfore , their conclusions can be misleading . 99 j. smajic , c. hafner and d. erni , `` optimization of photonic crystal structures '' , j. opt . a * 21 * , 2223 - 2232 ( 2004 )    d.h . wolpert and w.g . macready , `` no free lunch theorems for optimization '' , ieee transactions on evolutionary computation , * 1 * , 67 ( 1997 )    l. sanchis , a. hkansson , d. lpez - zann , j. bravo - abad , and jos snchez - dehesa , `` integrated optical devices design by genetic algorithm '' , appl . phys . lett . * 84 * , 4460 ( 2004 )    a. ishimaru , `` electromagnetic wave propagation , radiation , and scattering '' , englewood cliffs , new jersey ( 1991 )    d.e . goldberg , `` genetic algorithms in search , optimization and learning '' , addison wesley , reading , ma ( 1989 ) 1 . ga popultion dependecy . the best fitness in the population at every generation is printed out for four different gas . the four gas differ in population sizes and are applied to a problem coded with 182 bit - parameters . the following population sized were used 5 , 20 , 100 and 200 in a ) , b ) , c ) and d ) respectively . each ga is executed 5 times corresponding to the five lines in each graph . the average fitness value after 50000 evaluations and for 5 independent runs are for a ) 3.34 , b ) 3.69 , c ) 4.06 and for d ) 4.25
SUMMARY:recently , smajic _ et al . _ 
 @xcite published an article on numerical structural optimizations of two - dimensional photonic crystals using two different classes of optimization algorithms i.e , deterministic for local searches and stochastic for global . in this comment 
 we reexamine some of their conclusions regarding the global stochastic search strategies . 
 it is concluded that the steps taken to increase the efficiency of the optimization of the test problem chosen by smajic _

SUMMARY:we use postgresql dbms for storing xml metadata , described by the ivoa characterisation data model . 
 initial xml type support in the postgresql has recently been implemented . 
 we make heavy use of this feature in order to provide comprehensive search over characterisation metadata tree . 
 we built a prototype of the characterisation metadata query service , implementing two access methods : ( 1 ) http - get / post based interface implements almost direct translation of the query parameter name into xpath of the data model element in the xml serialisation ; ( 2 ) web - service based interface to receive xquery which is also directly translated into xpath . 
 this service will be used in the aspid - sr archive , containing science - ready data obtained with the russian 6-m telescope .

 we investigate the role of the individual h@xmath0ii regions together with the large - scale gravitational mechanisms which govern star formation and overall evolution in spiral galaxies . 
 our kinematical analysis ( reinforced by literature maps in hi and co at lower angular resolution ) enables us to verify the presence of an inner rapidly rotating inner disk - like component which we attribute to long term secular evolution of the large - scale spiral arms and oval structure . 
 we find that gas is falling in from the outer parts towards the bluer central regions . 
 this could be an early phase in the formation of a pseudo - bulge . 
 we find signatures of radial motions caused by an @xmath1 perturbation , which are likely to be responsible for the inflow of material forming the circumnuclear ring and the rapidly rotating inner structure .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the monitoring of the geomagnetic field has proved to be an auxiliary tool in the study of tsunami by several authors . the response of the ionosphere to tsunamis and the rayleigh and gravity waves induced by them has been studied broadly over the years @xcite , and modeled @xcite . it is well - known that post - seismic acoustic - gravity and rayleigh waves can be observable close to the epicenter ( in the near - field , within @xmath1 km with velocity up to @xmath2 ) due to direct the vertical displacement of the ground induced by the rupture . indeed , the rupture , as a dirac function , have a broad spectrum of energy including both , acoustic and gravity waves as presented on the detailed simulational - observational work by @xcite using tec and magnetic data . in the far - field , tsunamis induce pure gravity waves , and additionally rayleigh waves induce pure acoustic waves @xcite . more details could be found in @xcite . the theoretical and observational evidences show that tsunamis can generate rayleigh and acoustic gravity waves ( agws ) in the atmosphere / ionosphere by tsunami - atmosphere - ionosphere ( tai ) dynamic coupling , and this coupling effect do not modify the main frequencies of these waves . the presence of varieties of wavefronts propagating with velocity ranging between rayleigh to agw velocity was observed and discussed here for the first time using ground magnetic data for the japanese tsunami , @xmath0 in the near and far - field ( distances above @xmath1 km ) . these observations reaffirmed the idea that the magnetogram data can be used as a possible tool for tsunami warnings as it was already discussed by @xcite . on the 11th of march at @xmath3 ut , 2011 , a powerful earthquake of magnitude @xmath4 generated a catastrophic tsunami which propagated in the pacific ocean . the epicenter was centered at @xmath5n and long . @xmath6e , near to the coast of japan . to study this event , we used the minutely magnetogram data from the z - component from @xmath7 ground magnetic stations which are displayed on table  [ table : abbcode ] . in the work of @xcite , the wavelet analysis was proofed to be an alternative tool in detection of magnetic fields induced by the tsunami propagation . nowadays , the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) has been used in many different works in geophysics @xcite . the dwt is based on the multi - scale analysis and local regularities of the signal . considering @xmath8 as the analyzing wavelet , the wavelet coefficients of these transforms are dependent of two parameters : the scale @xmath9 and the central position of the wavelet analyzing function translation @xmath10 .    here , the orthogonal discrete wavelet transform was used @xcite . the key aspect of this transform is that the amplitude of the wavelet coefficients can be associated to the local polynomial approximation error which can be defined by the choose of the analyzing wavelet .    using the squared modulus of the wavelet coefficients @xmath11 , we can reproduce the discrete scalogram related to a discrete scale and a position , where the scale is related to a dyadic decomposition in levels @xmath12 , as @xmath13 and the translation is related to discrete position @xmath14 at level @xmath12 with @xmath15 .    in this context , we have that a signal @xmath16 can be represented by the expansion @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the wavelet coefficients computed from the @xmath19 inner - product @xmath20    the wavelet transform in level @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a high - pass filter , @xmath24 is the wavelet coefficient at level @xmath21 , @xmath25 are the scale coefficients at level @xmath12 , and @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ? * more details ) . in this work , we use the daubechies ( db2 ) wavelet function of order 2 , and therefore the non - zero low filter values are @xmath27 $ ] . also , the sampling rate of @xmath28 min , as consequence of the time resolution of the magnetic data , gives the pseudo - periods of the first three levels of @xmath29 and @xmath30 minutes , ( see * ? ? ? * more details ) .

SUMMARY:the continuous geomagnetic field survey holds an important potential in future prevention of tsunami damages , and also , it could be used in tsunami forecast . in this work 
 , we were able to detected for the first time rayleigh and ionospheric acoustic gravity wave propagation in the z - component of the geomagnetic field due to the japanese tsunami , @xmath0 prior to the tsunami arrival . 
 the geomagnetic measurements were obtained in the epicentral near and far - field . also , these waves were detected within minutes to few hours of the tsunami arrival . 
 for these reasons , these results are very encouraging , and confirmed that the geomagnetic field monitoring could play an important role in the tsunami warning systems , and also , it could provide additional information in the induced ionospheric wave propagation models due to tsunamis .

18,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: twenty years after the explosion , the blast wave from sn1987a has now reached and is plowing through the circumstellar ring . protrusions caused by rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the ring were hit first by the blast wave , giving rise to a series of `` hotspots '' around the ring [ 2,5,6 ] . the interaction has three different velocity components :    \1 . extremely broad ( @xmath215,000 to 15,000 km s@xmath3 ) emission in h@xmath1 and ly@xmath1 that traces h atoms crossing the reverse shock . this can be seen in low - resolution spectra [ 4 ] . one sees blueshifted emission to the north , and redshifted emission to the south , like the expansion pattern of the ring itself [ 1 ] . broad ( few 10@xmath4 km s@xmath3 ) components emitted by gas in the ring that has been passed over by the forward shock [ 2,3 ] . this is the emission from the `` hotspots '' narrow ( 10 s of km s@xmath3 ) emission lines from slow - moving gas in the circumstellar ring that has not yet been reached by the shock , but is photoionized by uv emission from the shock interaction [ 3 ] .    here we concentrate on the spatially resolved emission - line profiles of the shock - heated has in the hotspots on the north ( near ) and south ( far ) sides of the ring , seen in h@xmath1 and he  i @xmath010830 .    , and [ n  ii ] spectra . ] * observations : * we present high resolution ( r=60,000 ) ground - based spectra of the inner equatorial ring of sn  1987a . we used the phoenix spectrograph on gemini south to observe he  i @xmath010830 in apr 2006 , with the 0.5  slit oriented as in fig .  1 . these long - slit data spatially resolved the north and south sides of the ring ( fig.1a ) . we also used the mike echelle spectrograph at the magellan observatory to obtain the optical spectrum in march 2005 . the 2-d spectrum of h@xmath1 is shown in fig . tracings of the north and south sides of the rings are shown in figures 1c and d , respectively , for both lines as well as [ n  ii ] @xmath06583 . the [ n  ii ] line has stronger narrow emission from unshocked circumstellar gas , and is scaled up to show that the profile of its broad shocked component is identical to h@xmath1 . line profiles in fig .  1 . in the scenario depicted in figure 2 , we can understand the difference in line profile shape between he  i @xmath010830 and h@xmath1 as a consequence of ionization levels , geometry , and shock kinematics . when the expanding blast wave encounters an obstacle like an equatorial ring , with or without a protruding `` finger '' from rayleigh - taylor instabilities , the shock will penetrate the dense material head - on and decelerate , but it will also wrap around the object , transmitting weaker and slower oblique shocks into the sides of the obstacle ( see fig .  2 ) . the denser , cooler , slower , and lower - ionization gas in these oblique shocks probably dominates the h@xmath1 and broad [ n  ii ] emission [ 3 ] . this will produce broad emission at both blue and redshifted velocities . he  i @xmath010830 emission will arise in this same gas , but it is also likely to be enhanced relative to h@xmath1 in the hotter and higher ionization gas at the head of the shocked column . if true , that would in principle explain the observed line profiles , because that gas would have higher projected speeds on both the blue and red sides of the ring ( fig . 2 ) than the circumstellar gas struck by the oblique shocks in the side of the column , as observed ( fig .  1 ) . the enhanced he  i emission at the end of the shocked column , plus the weakness of the narrow he  i emission from unshocked gas ( less than 5% of the total ) means that he  i @xmath010830 images of the hotspots [ 6 ] are among the best tracers of the strong shocks in the circumstellar gas . a comparison of variability between h@xmath1 and he  i in high - resolution images might provide important clues about the geometry of the shock front . if the `` fingers '' that are being illuminated by the shock at the present time to produce the hotspots really are the inner protrusions from a more massive ring , then we should expect the ring to brighten dramatically in the near future in he  i @xmath010830 as this more extended material is overtaken by the main blast wave .
SUMMARY:we present the first high - dispersion spectroscopy of he  i @xmath010830 from the hotspots in the ring around sn1987a , obtained at gemini south , spatially resolving the near and far sides of the ring . 
 we compare these line profiles to similar echelle spectra of h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] @xmath06583 obtained at the magellan observatory . 
 we find that the he  i profiles are much broader than h@xmath1 or [ n  ii ] , but the he  i profiles also have different shapes  they have enhanced emission at high speeds , with extra blueshifted emission on the north side of the ring , and extra redshifted emission on the south side . to explain this , we invoke a simple geometric picture where the extra he  i emission traces hotter gas from faster shocks that strike the apex of the hotspots directly , while the h@xmath1 preferentially traces cooler lower - ionization gas from slower transverse shocks that penetrate into the sides of the ring .     address = astronomy department , university of california , 601 campbell hall , berkeley ca 94720     address = jila , university of colorado , 440 ucb , boulder , co 80309

SUMMARY:we present a generalized version of the path interchange zeldovich approximation ( piza ; croft and gaztaaga 1997 ; hereafter cg97 ) , which may be used to reconstruct density and velocity fields from realistic galaxy redshift surveys . 
 the original piza does not include the possibility of using galaxies in redshift space with a selection function . 
 we map galaxy positions from redshift to real space and from the local group rest frame to the cmb rest frame . to take account of the selection function , we minimize the mass - weighted action . 
 we apply our new method to mock galaxy catalogues and find it offers an improvement in reconstructions over linear theory . applying piza to the pscz we can obtain real space density , initial density , and peculiar velocity fields , bulk velocities and the dipole . 
 comparison of our reconstructed dipole with the cmb dipole gives @xmath0 .

TEXT: two - dimensional simulations of compressible convection have shown that it is possible to excite internal gravity waves ( igw ) in radiative zones of solar - type stars from the downward penetrating plumes ( hurlburt et al . , @xcite , hereafter htm86 ; hurlburt et al . , @xcite ; kiraga and jahn , @xcite ) . however , detecting igw with confidence is challenging given the stochastic nature of the excitation mechanism . we propose here a new detection method which allows us to measure rigorously both the spectrum and amplitude of excited @xmath0-modes . this method is first applied to the @xmath0-mode oscillations of an isothermal atmosphere and then , to igw generated in a 2d - simulation of a convective zone embedded between two stable ones . in hydrosimulations , wave fields are commonly measured using two main methods : _ ( i ) _ the simplest one consists in recording the vertical velocity at a fixed point and then performing the fourier transform of the sequence ( see , e.g. , htm86 ) ; _ ( ii ) _ a more complicated method consists in taking two fourier transforms , in space and time , of the vertical mass flux ( stein and nordlund , @xcite ) . however , these two methods are not well adapted to detect igw in our problem because the fourier transforms are calculated over the _ whole _ simulation while igw are _ stochastically _ excited by penetrating plumes . our new detection method takes into account the random nature of this excitation . indeed , it is based first , on projections of the simulated velocity field @xmath1 onto the anelastic eigenvectors @xmath2 as    @xmath3    and second , on time - frequency diagrams of the complex coefficients @xmath4 . as a consequence , the immediate spectrum ( the set of frequencies @xmath5 ) and amplitudes ( defined as @xmath6 ) of stochastically excited @xmath0-modes are reached and not only their `` mean '' values over the whole simulation . it is instructive to consider the simplest possible case , that is , the propagation of a single gravity mode with horizontal wavenumber @xmath7 through the computation domain : applying eq . ( [ projec ] ) leads in this case to a projection coefficient @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the frequency of the anelastic eigenmode of degree @xmath7 and order @xmath10 .

SUMMARY:the excitation of gravity waves by penetrative convective plumes is investigated using 2d direct simulations of compressible convection . 
 the oscillation field is measured by a new technique based on the projection of our simulation data onto the theoretical @xmath0-modes solutions of the associated linear eigenvalue problem . 
 this allows us to determine both the excited modes and their corresponding amplitudes accurately .

TEXT: in year 2012 , @xcite discovered a small cloud , later named `` g2 '' , at few thousands schwarzschild radii from sgra*. g2 has both a dust component , visible in the near infrared @xmath3 band , and a gaseous component , visible in br@xmath4 and other recombination lines . the cloud lies on a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath5 ) and reached its pericenter in early 2014 , with a distance from sgra * of @xmath6 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath7 ) . the line emission shows an increasing spatial extent and a broadening in the velocity space , interpreted as tidal stretching of the cloud by the tidal field of sgra * @xcite . observed position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams and br@xmath4 maps also show the presence of a tail ( g2 t ) , following g2 on roughly the same orbit @xcite . we performed 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulations with the code pluto to understand whether g2 s gas component can be the outflow of a central source . we start the source at apocenter and let it move on the best - fit orbit derived by @xcite . we include an idealized adaf - like atmosphere and the gravitational field of sgra * ( @xmath8 ) . the outflow initially expands with a spherical shape and stalls due to pressure balance . close to pericenter , the ram pressure of the atmosphere and the tidal force of the smbh increase . this leads to the stripping of the rayleigh - taylor fingers of shocked outflow material and to the stretching of the cloud ( see fig . we compare to observations by constructing mock position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams . for relatively high mass - loss rates ( @xmath0 ) and low velocity ( @xmath9 ) , the shocked outflow material can reasonably reproduce g2 in the observed pv diagrams , as in the case of the _ diffuse cloud scenario _ ( see conference contribution by marc schartmann ) . for same mass - loss rate , but higher velocity ( @xmath10 ) , the external ram pressure is more effective and the stripped material accumulates in the trailing region , forming a long tail ( see fig . the simulated pv diagrams , in the latter case , result in a bimodal emission ( see fig . 1c and * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) . in the latter scenario , g2 would be produced by the leading stagnation shock of the outflow and g2 t by the long tail of stripped material . as in the case of previous studies @xcite , our best matching parameters seem to suggest a massive outflow , typical of young stellar objects such as t tauri stars ( as already suggested by * ? ? * see also the conference contribution by michal zajaek ) . a t tauri star is also appealing , since it could naturally explain the presence of dust embedded in g2 . the nature of g2 remains an open question ; however , in the case of a compact source , we should be able to observe a decoupling between the source and the previous outflow ( i.e. , between the dust and gas components ) in the next 5 - 10 years ( see fig . a new g2 should reform around the source , later on .
SUMMARY:we study the evolution of g2 in a _ compact source scenario _ , where g2 is the outflow from a low - mass central star moving on the observed orbit . 
 this is done through 3d amr simulations of the hydrodynamic interaction of g2 with the surrounding hot accretion flow . 
 a comparison with observations is done by means of mock position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams . 
 we found that a massive ( @xmath0 ) and slow ( @xmath1 ) outflow can reproduce g2 s properties . a faster outflow ( @xmath2 ) might also be able to explain the material that seems to follow g2 on the same orbit .

SUMMARY:we have used a sample of 43 star - forming galaxies imaged in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) by the uit supplemented with 33 galaxies observed by faust , to explore the consistency of uv and h@xmath0 derived star formation rates ( sfrs ) . 
 we find , even before correction for dust , that uv and h@xmath0 sfrs are quantitatively consistent for low - luminosity galaxies , and that higher luminosity galaxies have h@xmath0 sfrs a factor of 1.5 higher than their uv sfrs : this reflects the influence of dust . 
 our results are consistent with a scenario where the uv dust extinction is a factor of @xmath12 larger than the h@xmath0 dust extinction in a given galaxy , and that there is over a 4 magnitude range of h@xmath0 dust extinctions which correlate loosely with galaxy luminosity such that low luminosity galaxies tend to have lower extinctions than their higher luminosity counterparts .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the last ten and the future ten years provide a large number of cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) experiments . their main goal is to estimate the cosmological parameters through sky temperature maps . the map - making is therefore a key question of these experiments , moreover with the advent of large time - ordered data ( tod ) being currently analysed or simulated . the `` brute force '' direct inversion of the linear map - making problem is beyond the reach of computing facilities of today . thus the data analysers need to find faster methods , which have to be as optimal in theory and as efficient in practice as possible . this is used to clean planck high frequency instrument ( bersanelli 1996 ) simulated data , to be published in giard ( 2000 ) . it uses a simple algorithm to destripe the data and make the map . the scanning strategy assumed to make the timeline is 1 round per minute of the beam on the sky , so that the timeline is a succession of circles on the sky . the cleaning algorithm follow the processing described below : first each circle is adjusted so that the measured signal fits a cosecant law ( galactic dust ) , plus dipole emission :    @xmath0    where k is the index of each circle of the data , i the data index along the circle , and @xmath1 the detector response . the free parameters are @xmath2 ( galactic emission for the circle k ) and @xmath3 ( constant to be subtracted ) . then we destripe the data using an algorithm derived from delabrouille ( 1998 ) which uses the scan intercepts . we adjust the constants to subtract to each circle k by minimising the spread between the measurements contributing to the same sky pixel . where a is the point - spread ( convolution ) matrix and n the random noise vector in the timeline . for cmb experiments , x would represent the pixelised sky map of the cmb temperature . the map - making problem is thus written as this :      where @xmath6 is the vector of the reconstructed sky map , and w the inversion matrix . the inversion matrix w depends on the method used . the simplest is the pixel averaging , but the optimal methods for estimating the map are the cobe method ( with no prior for x ) or the wiener filter ( with gaussian prior for x ) . see tegmark ( 1997 ) for a set of linear and non - linear map - making methods . as an example , the cobe method is written as this :          the cmb experiments now in analysis ( boomerang , maxima ... ) or to come ( archeops , map , planck ... ) provide several megabytes of time - ordered data . the noise covariance matrix , for instance , would be several terabytes of data , which is impossible to handle or even to write . how to solve optimally the map - making problem without writing any matrix anywhere ?    assuming no beam and the stationarity of the noise , it is possible to make the map iteratively handling only vectors . using the cobe method ( eq . [ cobe ] ) , the deconvolution equation ( eq . [ deconv_eq ] ) can be written as this :      if the noise is stationary , the matrix multiplication @xmath10 y is equivalent to a convolution by a kernel , i.e. a multiplication in the fourier space . if the beam is not taken into account , a is making a timeline from a map , and @xmath11 is the pixel averaging of a timeline into a map . [ eqltm ] leads to iterative methods such as :      where @xmath13 is a free parameter of the iterative method . it is also possible to make converge the noise map instead of directly the sky map , by changing the variable @xmath14 into @xmath15^{-1 } a^t y$ ] . bersanelli , m. , bouchet , f. , efstathiou , g. , griffin , m. , lamarre , j.m . , mandolesi , r. , nogaard - nielsen , h. , pace , o. , polny , j. , puget , j.l . , tauber , j. , vittorio , n. , volont , s. : 1996 , cobras / samba phase a report
SUMMARY:we present in this article two different ways to make cmb maps in practice , from large timelines . 
 one is to make a simple destriping , fitting the data and using the scan intercepts to remove the low frequency noise ( stripes ) .

SUMMARY:the gravitational evolution of the cosmic one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) can be estimated using an analytic approximation that combines gravitational perturbation theory ( pt ) with the edgeworth expansion around a gaussian pdf . 
 we present an alternative to the edgeworth series based on an expansion around the gamma pdf , which is more appropriate to describe a realistic pdf . 
 the gamma expansion converges when the pdf exhibits exponential tails , which are predicted by pt and n - body simulations in the weakly non - linear regime ( _ i.e _ , when the variance , @xmath0 , is small ) . 
 we compare both expansions to n - body simulations and find that the gamma expansion yields a better overall match to the numerical results .

( ii ) dense graphs - those for which @xmath2 is close to @xmath5 . here we presented the graph as the adjacency - list for the evaluation of our algorithm . + the vertex - cover problem is to find a minimum number of vertex to cover a given undirected graph . we call such a vertex cover an optimal vertex cover . this problem is the optimization version of an np - complete decision problem . proposed algorithm is polynomial time algorithm in order to find the set of vertex to cover the graph . which shows the better performance than the traditional algorithm for vertex cover @xcite . as it is np - hard problem so it is hard to find an optimal solution of a graph g , but not difficult to find a near optimal solution . our propose method gives very near optimal solution for vertex - cover problem . the following approximation algorithm takes an undirected graph g as input @xcite and returns a set of vertex to cover the graph and whose size is less than the previous method . + all graphs mentioned here are simple undirected graph . we follow @xcite for definitions . our proposed method ( see algorithm and fig.[fig:2 ] ) is on undirected graph . here we used the adjacency list to represent graph g. we introduce a new field _ weight _ in the _ list _ to store the degree of each individual vertex . _ i.e. _    struct list    \ {    char vertex ;    int weight ;    struct node * next ;    struct node * ref ;    } ;    [ 1 ] @xmath6 l = _ list _ l[w ] = reference weight ( h , v ) = highest weight of the list and respective vertex [ marker ] @xmath7 v[w ] @xmath8 l[w ] @xmath9 l[w]-1 * go to * [ marker ] @xmath10    it s space complexity is @xmath1 @xcite . for step 4 search in the list is o(v ) . in the for loop _ i.e. step 8 to 10 _ for each individual vertex need to search its reference vertices . so worst time complexity is @xmath11= @xmath12 . so the worst time complexity of the graph is @xmath0 .    _ ( thomas h. cormen et.al . @xcite ) _ [ vcp1 ] approx - vertex - cover is a polynomial - time 2-approximation algorithm .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: we use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method to model m51 and ngc 5195 . we take the orbit from @xcite , who performed many realisations using a combined n - body and genetic algorithm code , comparing the resulting velocity and density fields to the data of @xcite . their best - fit calculation provides the relative positions and velocities of the two galaxies at the start of our model . we set up the m51 galaxy using the mkkd95 program @xcite , and include a stellar and gaseous disc , and a live halo and bulge . with a total of 1.1 million particles , this gives a gas mass resolution of 180 m@xmath0 . the ngc 5195 galaxy is modelled by a point mass . the gas in m51 is isothermal ( 10@xmath1 k ) and represents 1% of the disc mass , chosen deliberately low to avoid stellar collapse which would halt the calculation . in figure  1 , we show the time evolution of the m51 galaxy . the galaxy undergoes a transition from a flocculent to a grand design galaxy ( in isolation the galaxy is a multi - armed spiral ) . the 180 and 300 myr frames indicate that the spiral structure winds up over time , and consequently there is no single pattern speed . the 300 myr time frame corresponds closest with the current day , at which point the overall shape of the spiral arms , and location of the companion agree well with the observed structure . after 370 myr , m51 and ngc 5195 start to merge ( not shown , but see @xcite ) .    in fig .  2 we compare the spiral structure in our simulation at a time of 300 myr with an hst image of m51 . as well as capturing the overall shape of the spiral arms , we also produce detailed features ; a kink in one spiral arm ( a ) , spiral arm bifurcations ( b ) and inter - arm gas ( c ) . the kink occurs where an inner spiral arm , which was induced during the first passage of ngc 5195 , meets an outer arm which is due to the second , more recent passage . spiral arm bifurcations and branches ( and interarm gas ) are the result of material shearing away from the spiral arms . a feature not seen in the actual m51 however , is a large amount of gas above the top arm . intriguingly though , in both simulations and observations there is gas extending from the companion ( d ) , and it is possible this gas extends further but is just not detected away from ngc 5195 . it is evident from fig .  1 that the spiral pattern winds up over time and in fig .  3 , we plot the pattern speed of the gaseous and stellar spiral arms versus radius . the pattern speed is calculated from the positions of the spiral arms at 180 and 300 myr , which in turn are determined by fitting gaussians to the azimuthal density profiles . we see from fig .  3 that the pattern speed decreases with radius , thus the spiral pattern is not in a quasi - steady state . the arms behave similarly to kinematic density waves , which have a pattern speed of @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) . the pattern in our simulations actually winds up slightly slower than this , due to self gravity . however there is only limited radially inward propagation of the spiral arms due to self gravity , thus they are not actually waves , rather spiral density patterns . dobbs , c. l. , theis , c. , pringle , j. e. , & bate , m. r. 2009 , mnras , submitted kuijken , k. , & dubinski , j. 1995 , mnras , 277 , 1341 oh , s. h. , kim , w .- t . , lee , h. m. , & kim , j. , 2008 , apj , 683 , 94 rots , a. h. , bosma , a. , van der hulst , j. m. , athanassoula , e. , & crane , p. c. , 1990 , aj , 100 , 387 theis , c. & spinneker , c. 2003 , ap&ss , 284 , 495
SUMMARY:the m51 galaxy is one of best examples of grand design structure in galaxies . 
 the most likely origin of the spiral arms in m51 is the ongoing interaction with ngc 5195 . 
 here we report recent calculations which model the orbit of m51 and ngc 5195 . these calculations , which for the first time focus on the gas dynamics , are able to reproduce even detailed features in m51 , as well as demonstrate the nature of the spiral structure of m51 .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: in this work we use all available data from rxte s pca to simultaneously study the spectral and timing properties in the transient low mass x - ray binary 4u 160852 . we calculate a color  color diagram . as the energy spectrum of a source changes , it moves through the diagram . to study the timing we calculate fourier power density spectra and fit them with the multi lorentzian fit function ; a sum of lorentzian components plus an occasional power law to fit the very low frequency noise @xcite . it has been recently proposed @xcite that the atoll sources trace out similar three branch patterns as the z sources ; one of our goals in this work is to test this hypothesis . + as a first step we go through the data in chronological order and look at the timing properties ( per observation ) and the position of the source in the color  color diagram . the obtained lightcurve and color  color diagram for 4u 160852 can be grouped into 3 parts . the first part ranges from 1996 march 3 to december 28 ( the decay of the 1996 outburst , see @xcite ) , the second part from 1998 february 3 to september 29 ( the 1998 outburst , see @xcite ) and the third part from 2000 march 6 to may 10 . in practice most data was available for the second part of the lightcurve ( the 1998 outburst ) so we will present the results for the second part of the lightcurve first . the results can then serve as a template for the rest of the data .    for the 1998 outburst we find 7 different color diagram position / power spectral classes and we can confirm the result of @xcite that the color  color diagram shows the classical atoll c shape ( see @xcite ) . for the decay of the 1996 outburst we find one additional class that was different from those observed during the 1998 outburst . the color  color diagram deviates from the c shape and if we sort the classes by characteristic frequency , the color  color diagram seems to follow an @xmath2 shape instead of the classical atoll shape ( see also below ) . in the third part of the data the source countrates were low and in most cases it was impossible to identify any power spectral features , therefore the classification for this part of the data was solely done on position in the color  color diagram . to improve the statistics of the power spectra we add up all the continuous time intervals in each of the 8 classes . to avoid doubling of the lower kilohertz qpo peak we split the class marked with the filled circles up into three parts depending on lower kilohertz qpo frequency . in figure [ fig : cc_int ] we show the resulting 10 intervals marked from a to j in the color  color diagram . +    we fit the power density spectrum of each interval of figure [ fig : cc_int ] with the multi lorentzian fit function . in figure [ fig : freq_freq ] we show the characteristic frequencies of the lorentzians used to fit the power spectra of 4u 160852 plotted versus the characteristic frequency of the lorentzian identified as the upper kilohertz qpo , together with the results of @xcite for 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 . the results of the multi lorentzian fit to 4u 160852 are remarkably similar to those of 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 . interval c in figure [ fig : cc_int ] represents a deviation from the classical atoll shape ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) . according to the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite interval c would represent the analogon to the horizontal branch of the z sources . as in z sources the characteristic frequencies of the timing features increase along the z starting at the horizontal branch , the measured frequencies in c should then be lower than those in a and b. instead we find that all characteristic frequencies clearly increase from a to j so that the frequencies in c are intermediate between those in b and d. this is not consistent with the idea that 4u 1608 - 52 traces out a three - branched z shape in the color - color diagram , this work was supported by nwo spinoza grant 080 to e.p.j . van den heuvel , by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) , and by the netherlands research school for astronomy ( nova ) . this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .
SUMMARY:we have studied the spectral and timing behaviour of the atoll source 4u 160852 . 
 we find that the timing behaviour of 4u 160852 is almost identical to that of the atoll sources 4u 0614 + 09 and 4u 172834 . 
 recently muno , remillard & chakrabarty ( 2002 ) and gierlinski & done ( 2002 ) suggested that the atoll sources trace out similar three 
 branch patterns as the z sources . 
 the timing behaviour is not consistent with the idea that 4u 160852 traces out a three  branched z shape in the color  color diagram along which the timing properties vary gradually .

25,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: neural networks represent a multidisciplinary field , including e.g. neuroscience , mathematics , statistics , computer science , engineering , and physics . we can generally look at the development of the artificial neural network ( ann ) field as few periods of extensive research , starting with the first idea of a neuron by w.  mcculloch and w.  pitts ( 1943 ) @xcite . in the @xmath0 , j.  hopfield introduced his recurrent neural network , while p.  werbos developed the back - propagation algorithm - one of the most widely used to this day @xcite , @xcite . the reader should note that all developed networks are based on deterministic approach . anns try to mimic only the four fundamental elements of the biological neurons - input , processing , learning and output . in order to be able to generate an output , they exploit the interconnection principle between biological neurons . we can broadly classify them by the type of learning : supervised or unsupervised . through the learning ( or training process ) , the weights and biases of the network are adapted . there are many strategies for learning , usually determined by the way the values are evolved . the main important characteristics of the learning process are represented by two concurring passages , i.e. the capacity to use minimum computational resources , and to provide robustness of the system . one further step remains the choice of the error function , or target function and the goal is to minimize the error by varying the weights of the ann . nowadays in the standard approach , the changes in the weights are usually accomplished during the training process , with particularly nothing being implemented in the utilization of the network . among the possible options used in the learning process , the gradient descent method is one of the most common . the back - propagation algorithm proposed in @xcite uses the error to propagate it through the network layer by layer until an outcome is produced . the backpropagation looks for the minimum value of the error function in weight space through delta rule or gradient descent . on the other hand we have evolutionary algorithms , which are generally directed random searches . they start from a set of random population , slowly converging to a solution @xcite . another interesting alternative is represented by simulated annealing @xcite , which in some situation can perform faster than backpropagation or genetic algorithms . by analogy with the physics problem discussed in @xcite , the strategy is based on the transition process of a solid substance from increased temperature to thermal equilibrium . in this context , the cooling of a substance becomes equivalent to minimize the cost function of an optimization problem . in @xcite the simulated annealing method is achieved by substituting the cost for energy , and executing the algorithm by slowly decreasing the temperature values .    to the best of our knowledge , the above concepts are strongly based on analogies with classical ( or deterministic ) physics . an interesting possibility is to exploit , in some sense , quantum mechanical effects in a ann . this was suggested for the first time in @xcite where biological aspects of quantum phenomena in brain activity related to the activation point by a nerve impulse are described .    in this article , the action potential plays a fundamental role in information processing inside the brain . the authors suggested that the firing of a neuron is obtained by the motion of a quantum particle , in the proximity of a potential ( or energetic ) barrier where typically effects such as tunnelling occurs . alternatives to this explanation exist such as the one proposed in @xcite based on the concept of micro - tubules which are able to maintain a macroscopic coherent superposition . in particular , the suggested explanation described in @xcite inspired us to develop a technique which mimics quantum effects in order to improve the set of weights of a ann in the _ post - learning _ stage . in more details , our method aims to reinforce the reliability of a network even in the case of training failure , at a relatively low computational cost . the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we introduce the methodology behind the development of our proposed network . then , in order to validate this novel approach , we perform a set of numerical experiments involved in the problem of approximating a known function . in spite of the simplicity of the proposed technique , we believe that it provides a further chance for the network to escape from local minima , local optima or saddle points @xcite at a reasonable computational burden . nowadays , neural networks come in a great variety of ways - classification , data analysis , dimensionality reduction , etc , and thus there are many different implementations of neural networks . among them we have , for example , the perceptron @xcite , the multilayer feedforward network @xcite , the probabilistic network @xcite . interesting alternative based on fuzzy logic can be found in @xcite,@xcite . in this work , we focus on multilayer feedforward network , which consist of many neurons , each of them fully connected to every neuron in adjacent forward layers , although the technique is not limited to this particular implementation .
SUMMARY:today artificial neural networks are applied in various fields - engineering , data analysis , robotics . while they represent a successful tool for a variety of relevant applications , mathematically speaking they are still far from being conclusive . in particular , they suffer from being unable to find the best configuration possible during the training process ( local minimum problem ) . in this paper , we focus on this issue and suggest a simple , but effective , post - learning strategy to allow the search for improved set of weights at a relatively small extra computational cost . therefore , we introduce a novel technique based on analogy with quantum effects occurring in nature as a way to improve ( and sometimes overcome ) this problem . 
 several numerical experiments are presented to validate the approach .

TEXT: smc x-1 is a luminous accretion - powered high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxrb ) with a b0 i primary and a rapid spinning pulsar ( 0.71 sec ) in a 3.89-day period ( wojdowski et al . fuse observed smc x-1 for almost an entire 3.89 day orbital period in 2003 july . a total of 71 exposures ( 148 ksec ) were obtained over 3.4 days , covering phase 0.20 , through x - ray source conjunction ( @xmath0 ) , and primary eclipse ( @xmath1 ) . the exposures were divided into nine phase bins , each with @xmath2 ksec and s / n@xmath3 per 0.05  . the ovi 1032 stellar wind line profile was corrected for milky way and smc interstellar h@xmath4 and ovi 1032 absorption by simultaneously modelling the ism lines in all nine spectra . the resulting ism model was subtracted from the observed ovi 1032 line at each phase ( see figure 1a for examples ) . the equivalent width of the ovi line was measured after the ism correction . figure 1b shows the strong variation of the ovi equivalent width with orbital phase . the orbital modulation of ovi in the stellar wind , the hm effect , is a result of ionization of the wind by the x - ray source . the large x - ray luminosity of smc x-1 ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) ionizes much of the wind and leaves a large stromgren zone . this disrupts the resonance - line acceleration of the wind in portions of the orbit , quencing the wind and disrupting the mass flow . the ovi wind absorption is strongly asymmetric around the orbit . the line is at maximum strength during the eclipse of the pulsar @xmath7 0.0 . the ovi line virtually disappears near @xmath8 . the ovi 1032 column density during eclipse is @xmath9 @xmath10 . the ovi terminal velocity ( @xmath11700 km / s ) drops to near zero at @xmath7 0.3 - 0.4 . 4u1700 - 37 has an o6.5 iaf primary in a 3.451 day orbital period with a neutron star or black hole secondary . the system is believed to have escaped from sco ob i about 2.5 million years ago . most recent mass estimates by clark et al . ( 2002 ) , who found @xmath12 and @xmath13 . no x - ray /radio pulses or other periodicities are known , however rxte asm and cgro batse data show evidence of a 13.8 day periodicity . ( hong & hailey , 2004 ) . 4u1700 - 37 has been observed by fuse at the four quadrature points of the binary orbit in 2003 april and august and the hm effect ( hatchett & mccray 1977 ) has been observed for the first time in this system , 27 years after its prediction . the hm effect was predicted for 4u17000 - 37/hd153919 , but was not detected in nv 1240 , siiv 1400 , or civ 1550 in iue and hst data . the pv 1118 - 1128 and siv 1063 - 1073 p- cygni lines are weakest at @xmath14 ( x - ray source conjuction ) and strongest at @xmath15 for the red wing and at @xmath16 for the blue wing ( see figure 2 ) . the ovi and svi wind lines show orbital modulation different from pv and siv and are strongest at @xmath14 and weakest at @xmath16 ( x - ray source eclipse ) , implying that ovi and svi are byproducts of the wind s ionization by the x - ray source . such variations were not observed in nv , siiv and civ because of their high optical depth . the pv and siv transitions , on the other hand , are excellent tracers of the ionization conditions in the o star s wind . pv is the dominant ionization stage in the wind and has lower cosmic abundance than c , n or si . there is very little change in the terminal velocity ( @xmath17 km / sec ) of the wind with phase .
SUMMARY:the high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrb s ) smc x-1 and 4u1700 - 37 have been observed with fuse to study the effect of the x - ray source on the stellar wind of the primary . in both systems 
 phase dependent changes in the wind lines have been observed , indicating the creation of a x - ray ionization zone in the stellar wind . 
 the high x - ray luminosity of smc x-1 ionizes much of the wind and leaves a stromgren zone . 
 this disrupts the resonance - line acceleration of the wind in portions of the orbit , quencing the wind and disrupting the mass flow . 
 a similar but less dramatic effect was found for the first time in 4u1700 - 37 . 
 this so - called hatchett - mccray ( hm ) effect had been predicted for 4u1700 - 37 , but was not previously detected .

SUMMARY:this article describes the fluid dynamics video : `` effect of bubble deformability on the vertical channel bubbly flow . '' 
 the effect of bubble deformability on the flow rate of bubbly upflow in a turbulent vertical channel is examined using direct numerical simulations . 
 a series of simulations with bubbles of decreasing deformability reveals a sharp transition from a flow with deformable bubbles uniformly distributed in the middle of the channel to a flow with nearly spherical bubbles with a wall - peak bubble distribution and a much lower flow rate .

TEXT: work on extending stochastic processes characterized by a single index to corresponding processes with two indices or processes with variable index has attracted considerable interest lately . for example , fractional brownian motion parametrized by a constant hurst index @xmath0 has recently been generalized to the bifractional brownian motion @xcite characterized by two indices , with fractional brownian motion as a special case . a process with two indices provides a more flexible model as far as applications are concerned . fractional brownian motion has also been extended to multifractional brownian motion with a variable index @xmath1 @xcite . multifractional brownian motion allows one to model phenomena with variable memory and fractal dimension that changes with time or position . another example is the process of cauchy class @xcite , which has been extended to the process with two - indices known as generalized cauchy process @xcite . in contrast to many other single - index processes ( for example , fractional brownian motion ) , generalized cauchy process has the advantage that its two indices separately characterize the fractal dimension or self - similar property and the long range dependence . the aim of this paper is to introduce a new type of fractional gaussian process indexed by two parameters so that its short range dependence property and fractal dimension can be separately characterized . such a process can be regarded as a generalization of fractional oscillator process or fractional ornstein - uhlenbeck process with single index @xcite . this paper is organized as follows . section 2 introduces the generalized fractional oscillator process as solution of a stochastic differential equation with two fractional orders . despite the covariance of this process does not have a closed analytic form , its basic properties can be studied by considering the asymptotic properties of its covariance . in particular , the fractal dimension and short range dependence are studied . the fluctuation dissipation relation are discussed in section 4 . in section 5 , we consider the fractional oscillator process as one - dimensional euclidean fractional scalar field . stochastic quantization of the field at zero and finite temperature is carried out . we proceed to calculate the casimir energy associated with the fractional field at finite temperature by employing the zeta function regularization technique . in the last section , we briefly discuss possible generalizations of the results obtained . in this section we define the fractional oscillator process with two indices . recall that an ordinary oscillator process @xmath2 can be obtained as a solution to the langevin equation @xmath3where @xmath4 is the standard white noise with @xmath5@xmath6 is the standard brownian motion , and @xmath7 is a positive constant . using fourier transform , the solution of can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the standard white noise @xmath10 : @xmath11 in the literature , @xmath2 is known as the oscillator process or the ornstein  uhlenbeck process . it is a centered stationary gaussian process with covariance function @xmath12 one can also regard the oscillator process @xmath2 as one - dimensional euclidean scalar klein gordon field with mass @xmath7 , and propagator given by the spectral density @xmath13    since fractal dynamics @xcite have increasingly played an important role in various transport phenomena in complex media , it would be interesting to investigate various possible generalizations of @xmath2 to its fractional counterpart . one direct way is to replace the differential operator @xmath14 in by the fractional differential operator @xmath15 to obtain the following type i fractional langevin equation @xcite : @xmath16where the fractional derivative @xmath15 is defined as @xcite : @xmath17 when @xmath18 , @xmath19 is known as the riemann  liouville fractional derivative ; and for @xmath20 , @xmath21 is called the weyl fractional derivative . another possible generalization is to fractionalize the operator @xmath22 to obtain the following type ii fractional langevin equation @xcite:@xmath23recently we have combined the investigation on these two type of processes and study the more general case @xcite : @xmath24 if weyl fractional derivative is used in , then for @xmath25 , @xmath26 turns out to be a centered stationary gaussian process with a representation @xmath27and covariance function latexmath:[\]]where @xmath435and follows . r. metzler and j. klafter , _ the restaurant at the end of the random walk : recent developments in the description of anomalous transport by fractional dynamics _ , j. phys . a. : math . gen . * 37 * , r161208 ( 2004 ) .
SUMMARY:we introduce a new fractional oscillator process which can be obtained as solution of a stochastic differential equation with two fractional orders . 
 basic properties such as fractal dimension and short range dependence of the process are studied by considering the asymptotic properties of its covariance function . the fluctuation 
 dissipation relation of the process is investigated . 
 the fractional oscillator process can be regarded as one - dimensional fractional euclidean klein - gordon field , which can be obtained by applying the parisi - wu stochastic quantization method to a nonlocal euclidean action . 
 the casimir energy associated with the fractional field at positive temperature is calculated by using the zeta function regularization technique .

 eclipse maps show evidences of the formation of a spiral structure in the disc at the early stages of the outburst and reveal how the disc expands during the rise until its fills most of the primary roche lobe at maximum light . during the decline phase , 
 the disc becomes progressively fainter as the cooling front moves inwards from the outer regions , until only a small bright region around the white dwarf is left at minimum light . 
 the variable part of the uneclipsed light is possibly due to emission in a wind emanating from the inner parts of the disc . 
 the emission from this region is sensitive to the mass accretion rate .    #

[ fig : flux ] ) . the decay timescales are different at lower and higher energies : while a decay time of 30d is observed above 20ke-0.09em v , it is only 20d below 15ke-0.09em v. such behavior is typically observed in systems where an irradiated disk is present which , however , is not the case for v0332@xmath053 . since @xmath2 , this picture suggests that @xmath3 . the transition to the linear phase would then be triggered by a yet unknown change in the disk . to study the evolution of the spectrum over the outburst , we used the simple model , modified by two gaussian absorption lines to model the crsfs at @xmath127ke-0.09em vand @xmath151ke-0.09em vfor all observations . while the folding energy remains constant at @xmath17.5ke-0.09em v , the power law index @xmath4 decreases from @xmath5 in the first observation to @xmath6 in the last observations  the spectrum of v0332@xmath053hardens over the outburst . the fundamental cyclotron line also changes over the outburst : the energy increases from 27.5ke-0.09em vin the first _ integral_observation to 29.5ke-0.09em vin the last observations . moreover , during the previous _ rxte_observation , the fundamental crsf was observed at 26.3ke-0.09em v@xcite resulting in a total increase of more than 3ke-0.09em v. this change is highly significant : fitting the last _ integral_observations with a crsf energy fixed to 27.5ke-0.09em vresults in strong residuals and a completely unacceptable fit . the same holds true for the continuum : fixing the other continuum parameters also results in unacceptable fits . the determination of the parameters of the second crsf , however , is problematic for the second half of the observations as with decreasing flux , statistics become poor . the exponential decay of the flux and the transition to a linear phase later is frequently observed in sxts and dwarf novae @xcite . while the emission mechanism is entirely different for v0332@xmath053 , the similarity is striking and a yet unidentified change in the disk can be assumed to trigger the transition to the linear phase . the luminosity dependence of the energy of crsfs had already been observed previously @xcite and was assumed to be due a change in height of the crsf formation region in the accretion column . based on our data , we derive a change in height of @xmath1300 m ; however , a slightly different picture is also possible : the crsf emission region can be assumed to be extended along the accretion column . the observed broad crsfs would then be superposition of many narrower lines , each from a different height in the column . as the accretion rate drops , the extend of the emission region and its height both decrease and hence the energy of the crsf increases while it gets narrower as is observed for v0332@xmath053(see fig .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: in this video , we describe the formation of liquid pearls with millimetric scale diameter having a few micrometer thick hydrogel alginate membrane . these pearls can contain almost all type of liquids from pure water to oil . their formation is based on a two step procedure : the breakup of a compound pending drop followed by the solidification of the coating layer once the compound drop enters a gelling calcium bath . making the skin thin enough but still being able to turn into an elastic sheet is shown to be possible by controlling the interfacial properties with surfactants . here we show how to suppress the most important instabilities inherent to that two step procedure . indeed , the main instability arises from the mixing of the thin alginate solution layer with the surrounding miscible liquids . this is suppressed by inducing a two dimensional surfactant solidification at the drop interface which surprisingly transforms this interface into a transient elastic membrane . this allows the persistence of the surrounding layer until gelling takes place allowing formation of few micrometer thick membrane . the compound drop is formed from two coaxial tubes in a dual dripping regime . the outer diameter @xmath0 of the outer needle , that sets the drop diameter , is 3 mm . the flow of both liquid phases are driven by syringe pumps and the ratio of the flow rates @xmath1 fixes the average thickness of the shell . depending on the outer solution surface tension and the core density , the compound drop radius @xmath2 varies between 1.8 mm and 2.2 mm and the flow rate ratio @xmath1 spans from 1 to 1000 that lead to an average thickness @xmath3 that varies from 0.6 @xmath4 m to 150 @xmath4 m . the outer fluid is an aqueous solution containing 20 g of sodium alginate ( a polysaccharide produced by brown algae ) , for 1000 g of milli - q water . the alginate solution exhibits a shear thinning behavior with a viscosity of 5 500 mpa.s at a zero frequency . the interfacial properties are modified by adding to the alginate solution an anionic surfactant , sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) that is characterized by a critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) close to 8 mm . the pure alginate solution is characterized by a surface tension @xmath5 of 72 mn / m that drops down to 35 mm / m when 10 mm of sds is added . milli - q water is used as aqueous core . for hydrophobic cores , we choose silicone oils of various viscosities that span from 1 mpa.s to 1000 mpa.s . the surface tension @xmath6 of the oils is around 21 mn / m and the interfacial tension @xmath7 between the oil and a pure alginate solution is 40 mn / m and drops down to 14 mm / m when 10 mm of sds is added into the solution . + the compound drop is then gelled once it enters a water bath containing 15 % in weight of calcium chloride ( cacl@xmath8 ) by diffusion of the calcium ions through the alginate solution . the cacl@xmath8 concentration leads to a density of the solution of 1130 kg / m@xmath9 . + the impact of the compound drop into the gelling bath are visualized with the help of a high speed camera through a macro lens . the impact dynamics is shown in the present video and helps to understand how the formation of such liquid pearls is made possible by controlling the physicochemical conditions of the fluid interfaces . more information can be found in the following paper : + n. bremond , e. santanach - carreras , l. y. chu , j. bibette , 2010 , _ soft matter _ * 6 * , 2484 - 2488
SUMMARY:this fluid dynamics video reports how to form liquid core capsules having a thin hydrogel elastic membrane named liquid pearls . 
 these fish - egg like structures are initially made of a millimetric liquid drop , aqueous or not , coated with an aqueous liquid film containing sodium alginate that gels once the double drop enters a calcium chloride bath . 
 the creation of such pearls with micrometer thick membrane requires to suppress mixing until gelling takes place . here 
 , we show that superimposing a two dimensional surfactant precipitation at the interface confers a transient rigidity that can damp the shear induced instability at impact . based on this 
 , pearls containing almost any type of liquids can be created . 
 the video focuses on the dynamics of the entry of the compound drop into the gelling bath .

SUMMARY:we report results from full qcd calculations with two flavors of dynamical staggered fermions on anisotropic lattices . 
 the physical anisotropy as determined from spatial and temporal masses , their corresponding dispersion relations , and spatial and temporal wilson loops is studied as a function of the bare gauge anisotropy and the bare velocity of light appearing in the dirac operator . 
 the anisotropy dependence of staggered fermion flavor symmetry breaking is also examined . 
 these results will then be applied to the study of 2-flavor qcd thermodynamics .    #

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: cepheid cses are interesting for several aspects . firstly , they might be related to the past or ongoing stellar mass loss , and might be used to trace the cepheid evolution history . secondly , their presence may bias distance determination using baade - wesselink methods , and then bias the calibration of the ir period  luminosity ( p  l ) relation . galactic cepheids in binary systems are also important to measure fundamental stellar parameters . the dynamical masses can be estimated , providing new constraints on evolution and pulsation theory . this would give a new insight on cepheid masses , and might settle the discrepancy between pulsation and evolution masses . binary systems are also valuable for obtaining independent distances to cepheids , needed to calibrate the p  l relation . the characterization of cses is essential as they give access to the present mass - loss rate of cepheids . the cses were probably formed through past or ongoing mass loss , possibly generated by shock waves in the pulsating atmosphere of cepheid . our recent work using the mid - ir instrument vlti / midi ( 2-beams combiner ) enabled us to use the radiative transfer code ` dusty ` to model the cses of x  sgr and t  mon ( ( * ? ? ? * gallenne et al .  2013b ) ) . the fitted models gave mass - loss rates in the range @xmath0@xmath1yr@xmath2 , consistent with the expected theoretical range . we also estimated a relative ir excess in agreement with our previous work ( ( * ? ? ? * gallenne et al . 2011 ) ) , and derived a mid - ir correlation between the relative excess and the pulsation period of cepheids . this correlation shows that longer - period cepheids have larger ir excesses .    in the near - ir the cse flux emission might be negligible compared to the photospheric continuum , but this is not the case in the mid - ir , where the cse emission dominates . this has an impact on the calibration of the p l relation in the thermal domain ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * monson et al .  2012 ) ) , while the bias in the @xmath3 band still needs to be more deeply studied . most of cepheid companions are located too close to a cepheid ( @xmath440mas ) to be spatially resolved with a single - dish telescope . we are engaged in a long - term interferometric observing program , that aims at detecting and characterizing the companions of nearby cepheids . our main objectives are the determination of accurate masses and geometric distances from high - precision astrometry . the derived empirical masses will provide very valuable constraints in modeling the pulsation and evolution of intermediate - mass stars . * gallenne et al .  ( 2013a ) ) presented the first results of this program for the cepheid v1334  cyg , using the chara / mirc instrument ( 6-beams combiner ) . the companion was clearly detected in the closure phase signal . we combined our astrometric measurements with spectroscopic data to derive the complete set of orbital elements . we were also able to estimate the lower limit for the mass and distance . recently , the companion of aw per and ax  cir was also detected using the ir combiner chara / mirc and vlti / pionier , respectively , and the results will be published soon . thanks to the high angular resolution provided by interferometry , we are able to study the close environment of cepheids . it is important to keep analyzing the effect of the cses on the near- and mid - ir p l relation , and probe the origin of their presence . empirical masses of cepheids are also particularly important to constrain theoretical models . binary cepheids are the best tools for such measurements . interferometry coupled with radial velocity measurements seems to be a powerful way to estimate cepheid masses . * acknowledgments . * ag acknowledges support from fondecyt grant 3130361 . jdm acknowledges funding from the nsf grants ast-0707927 and ast-0807577 . wg and gp gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work from the basal centro de astrofsica y tecnologas afines ( cata ) pfb-06/2007 . support from the polish national science centre grant maestro dec-2012/06/a / st9/00269 and the polish ministry of science grant ideas plus ( awarded to gp ) is also acknowledged .
SUMMARY:optical interferometry is the only technique giving access to milli - arcsecond ( mas ) resolution at infrared wavelengths . for cepheids , 
 this is a powerful and unique tool to detect the orbiting companions and the circumstellar envelopes ( cse ) . 
 cses are interesting because they might be used to trace the cepheid evolution history , and more particularly they could impact the distance scale . 
 cepheids belonging to binary systems offer an unique opportunity to make progress in resolving the cepheid mass discrepancy . 
 the combination of spectroscopic and interferometric measurements will allow us to derive the orbital elements , distances , and dynamical masses . here

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: nucleon decay is one of the most important aspect that any ( susy ) gut model has . in low - energy effective theories it is represented by dimension six operators made of one lepton field and three quark fields . in the decay of @xmath0 , for example , we need to calculate hadronic matrix element of the three quark operator @xmath1 with initial proton and final pion states , where @xmath2 is the charge conjugation matrix . @xmath3 represents the right or left projection matrix , respectively . lattice calculation of the nucleon decay matrix elements historically started with the indirect calculation @xcite . first , one estimates the overlap of the operator to the proton state , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the proton spinor . then , with the help of chiral perturbation theory , one can calculate the nucleon decay matrix elements . the first attempt to calculate the nucleon decay matrix element directly handling the three point function is done by gavela et . al @xcite , showing significant deviation from the indirect calculations . recently jlqcd @xcite pointed out the incompleteness of the calculation @xcite . the matrix element has a tensor structure , @xmath8 u_p,\ ] ] where @xmath9 . the relevant form factor @xmath10 is what we need since the term proportional to @xmath11 vanishes after multiplying the lepton spinor . @xmath12 is called the irrelevant form factor . jlqcd uses quenched wilson gauge configurations and wilson fermion at parameters summarized in table  [ tab : param ] ( c ) . the three quark operators are renormalized with one - loop perturbation theory . now the difference of direct and indirect calculations is not huge , but , still @xmath13 to @xmath14 for most cases .    in this study we try to calculate nucleon decay matrix elements with domain - wall fermions in the quenched approximation . using dbw2 gauge action makes chiral symmetry breaking especially small compared to the other actions @xcite . with this good chiral symmetry one expects the good property to calculate hadronic matrix elements : 1 ) preventing operator mixing with different chiral structure , and 2 ) good scaling , even down to @xmath15 gev region @xcite . we restrict ourselves to the case of degenerate quark mass in the meson . in this case , one can calculate @xmath16 and @xmath17 decay amplitudes . the latter is obtained by multiplying the former by @xmath18 under the exact su(2 ) symmetry of @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks .

SUMMARY:we report on the nucleon decay matrix elements with domain - wall fermions in quenched approximation . 
 results from direct and indirect method are compared with a focus on the process of a proton decaying to a pion and a lepton . 
 we discuss the renormalization necessary for the matching to the continuum theory .

31,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: an energy - flow through a system is related to an entropy - flow . if the entropy - flow leaving the system is larger than the entering one , the system evacuates its internal , by irreversible processes produced entropy to the outer world . consequently order is created inside the system , diverging from the classical thermodynamical equilibrium of a closed system . far from equilibrium the system is no longer characterized by an extremum principle , thus losing its stability . therefore perturbations can lead to long range order , through which the system acts as a whole . such a behavior is well known in laboratory hydrodynamics and chemistry . the underlying concepts such as `` dissipative structures '' and `` self - organization '' were extensively studied ( see e.g. nicolis & prigogine 1977 ) . but in spite of their popularity they are until now only little studied in the context of non - equilibrium structures in self - gravitating astrophysical systems . therefore we take up some ideas of these concepts and build a simple model of an open self - gravitating system . with this model we want to check if an energy - flow can maintain a self - gravitating system in an statistically stable state , out of thermodynamical equilibrium and if gravitation in combination with an energy flow can create structures with a higher degree of order . taking into account the highly clumpy nature of the interstellar medium , we use in our model dissipative particles , representing dense cloud fragments , to simulate cosmic gas ( pfenniger 1998 ) . moreover , with such a realization we can check some thermodynamic results of self - gravitating systems . in order to prevent gravitationally unbound particles from dissolution , we confine the particles in a spherical potential well . this prevents matter flow . but the system is subjected to an energy flow , maintaining the system out of equilibrium . this flow is sustained by energy injection ( heating ) on large scales and local dissipation . the energy injection is due to time and position dependent potential perturbations . if the system represents a molecular cloud , then these potential perturbations can stem from star clusters , clouds or other high mass objects passing in the vicinity . indeed such stochastic encounters must be quite frequent in galactic discs and we assume , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean frequency of the encounters . thus these encounters can provide a continuing low frequency energy injection on large scales . the dissipation is due to `` inelastic particle encounters '' . therefore we add friction forces to the equation of motion , depending on the relative particle velocities and positions . if we switch off the heating process and use instead the local dissipation scheme ( `` inelastic particle encounters '' ) a scheme that dissipates the energy globally , then we can maintain the system during its evolution nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium . thus we can perform some simple `` thermodynamic experiments '' of self - gravitating systems with softened potentials . potential perturbations caused by astrophysical objects passing in the vicinity of a system can compensate the energy loss due to dissipation , thus prevent the system from collapsing and maintain a statistical equilibrium . this statistically steady state consists of a cold core moving in a hotter halo . the energy - flow leads however not to a phase transition to higher ordered structures . the gravo - thermal experiments lead to the following results : a plummer softened potential yields the same range of negative specific heat as found by follana & laliena . the negative specific heat range is related to a phase transition , separating a high energy homogeneous phase from a collapsed phase . as long as cooling processes are at work the collapsed phase shows no core - halo structure . after the cooling has stopped such a structure is formed on the relaxation time scale . follana e. , laliena v. , cond - mat/9911107 nicolis g. , prigogine i. , 1977 , self - organization in non - equilibrium systems , wiley , new york pfenniger d. , 1998 , in : @xmath3 in the early universe , eds . palla f. , corbelli e. , galli d. , memorie della societa astronomica italiana , 429
SUMMARY:real physical systems are often maintained off equilibrium by energy or matter flows . 
 if these systems are far from equilibrium then the thermodynamical branch become unstable and fluctuations can lead them to other more stable states . 
 these new states are often endowed with higher degrees of organization . in order to explore whether an energy - flow in combination with self - gravity can lead to complex , inhomogeneous structures , 
 like observed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , we perform @xmath0-body simulations of self - gravitating systems subjected to an energy - flow . 
 moreover we perform some simple `` gravo - thermal '' n - body experiments and compare them with theoretical results . 
 we find negative specific heat in an energy range as predicted by follana & laliena ( 1999 ) .

2 . what are the degeneracies between different parameters ? 3 . what snr and spectral resolution are required to get a given precision ? are various models of stellar populations consistent ?    _ biases and degeneracy . _ we have performed extensive monte - carlo simulations to fit ssp or sfh containing two bursts with snr ranging from 1 to 500 pix@xmath3 ( at r=10000 ; pix=0.2 ) . as long as the grid of models is fine enough for performing good interpolation , our method is not biased down to snr=5 pix@xmath3 . the main degeneracy is naturally between age and metallicity , but fig  [ fig:1 ] presents also the degeneracy between @xmath4 and @xmath2 : a discrepancy toward higher @xmath2 ( sharp lines ) is compensated by higher @xmath4 . this latter degeneracy is the strongest coupling between the kinematical and population parameters . an error of 1 dex on the metallicity results in an error of about @xmath5 on the velocity dispersion . this can introduce a significant systematics in the determination of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies . this effect is considerably reduced if an additive continuum is included in the fit , but in this case constraints on the stellar populations are lost . _ relation between precision and snr . _ the precision essentially depends on the total snr integrated over the whole wavelength range ( fig  [ fig:2 ] ) : a lower snr per pixel can be balanced by a larger number of pixels . when the wavelength range is shortened to exclude the blue region containing h@xmath6 line and bluer ( but keeping the same total snr ) , the precision on kinematics and metallicity is not seriously affected , but the precision on age becomes twice worse .    , @xmath4 = 50kms@xmath3,title=""fig:"",height=188 ] , @xmath4 = 50kms@xmath3,title=""fig:"",height=188 ]    _ relation between resolution and precision_. the precision on kinematical and population parameters depends on ( @xmath7)(fig  [ fig:3 ] ) , where @xmath8 is the instrumental velocity dispersion . the resolution is an important parameter for the precise determination of the kinematics . but it has weaker influence over the errors on age and metallicity .(see the relations below . ) when @xmath9 , the different minimization strategies that we experimented generally become unstable to measure the internal kinematics . the method based on the pixel fitting with pegase.hr templates can efficiently constrain kinematics and stellar population . we summarize below the relations between the errors on the population characteristics , the total signal to noise ratio , and the resolution ( for the spectral range 4000 6800 ) :       these relations are useful to select the observational setup : what is the optimal compromise between the spectral dispersion and the size of the spatial elements that minimizes the errors in a given observing time ? considering only the sources of uncertainties modeled in our simulations , it appears that the best precision on the internal kinematics will be obtained when @xmath10 . for the best precision on the parameters of the stellar population it is preferable to maximize the total snr with a lower dispersion . still , a single setup with a resolution matching the velocity dispersion is in general the good choice . the template mismatch due to abundance effects and the uncertainties in the modeling of a stellar populations are probably the source of significant biases on the parameters of the stellar population . in particular , we can guess that if balmer lines are not in the wavelength range , the determination of age will be extremely sensitive to abundance mismatch . we have inverted observations of globular clusters @xcite and simulated spectra from bruzual & charlot @xcite . for old populations the estimates appear too young and metallic . we are investigating the origin of this problem that may be connected with the bias found by prieto et al . @xcite in the elodie library . range from 400 to 680  nm and dispersion of 0.2 / pix . the curves noted bc03 are representing simulations with bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , and those noted rose gc are observation of globular clusters by rose et al . ( 2005 ) , all analyzed with pegase.hr templates . errors are proportional to ( total snr)@xmath3 , see the formula in the text.,height=566 ]
SUMMARY:3d spectroscopy produces hundreds of spectra from which maps of the characteristics of stellar populations ( age - metallicity ) and internal kinematics of galaxies can be derived . 
 we carried on simulations to assess the reliability of inversion methods and to define the requirements for future observations . 
 we quantify the biases and show that to minimize the errors on the kinematics , age and metallicity ( in a given observing time ) the size of the spatial elements and the spectral dispersion should be chosen to obtain an instrumental velocity dispersion comparable to the physical dispersion .

32,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: vela x is the pulsar wind nebula near the center of the vela supernova remnant ( bock , turtle , & green 1998b ) . in total intensity , the radio emission is dominated by synchrotron filaments which have no clear optical counterpart ( bock et al . the remnant s distance of 350 pc pc ( caraveo et al .  1991 ) and a radio parallax of @xmath1 pc ( legge 2001 ) ] makes it one of the nearest snrs , and thus one of the easiest to study . its age , 10,000 yr , is much larger than that of the crab nebula , and we can hope to learn something about remnant evolution by comparing the sources . high quality interferometric polarimetry now makes it possible to study at sub - arcminute resolution the magnetic fields in pulsar - powered nebulae , and in the galaxy as a whole . images of part of vela x. some locations where depolarization is coincident with h@xmath0 emission are marked with stars . the position of the pulsar is marked with a cross . the maximum polarized intensity is 180 mjy  beam@xmath2 . the artifacts in the h@xmath0 image are due to imperfect subtraction of the stellar component.,title=""fig:"",height=466 ]    images of part of vela x. some locations where depolarization is coincident with h@xmath0 emission are marked with stars . the position of the pulsar is marked with a cross . the maximum polarized intensity is 180 mjy  beam@xmath2 . the artifacts in the h@xmath0 image are due to imperfect subtraction of the stellar component.,title=""fig:"",height=466 ]    [ fig : ha ]    observations of vela x at 1.4 ghz were obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) using configurations which yielded a @xmath3 beam . images were made using multi - frequency synthesis and deconvolution was performed with a maximum entropy method algorithm . the total intensity image includes large - scale structure which was measured with the parkes telescope . however , there is little structure in polarized intensity larger than that sampled by the interferometer , so single - dish data has not been included in the polarization images . see sault , bock , & duncan ( 1999 ) for additional details . a grayscale image showing the polarized intensity measured from part of vela x is shown in figure  [ fig : p ] . the emission is up to 60% linearly polarized ; there is no detectable circular polarization . figure  [ fig : ha ] also shows the h@xmath0 emission from the same region ( from the survey of buxton , bessell , & watson 1998 ) . vectors representing the intensity and e - field direction of the polarized emission are plotted on a total intensity image in figure  [ fig : ppa ] . the synthesized beam and a bar representing the maximum polarized intensity of 106 mjy  beam@xmath2 are shown at the lower right . the three unresolved sources are most likely of extragalactic origin . , height=415 ]    the most striking aspect of the polarimetric image of vela x ( figure [ fig : p ] ) is the complex network of ` canals ' criss - crossing the broader synchrotron filaments . these canals are unresolved , indicating that they are probably due to faraday depolarization within the synthesized beam , caused by rapid spatial changes in the foreground rotation measure ( rm ) . they have no counterpart in total intensity . similar features have been seen in the background galactic radiation ( gaensler et al . 2001 , and references therein ) . however , in the present case we have been able to identify optical counterparts for many of the canals among h@xmath0 filaments originating in the shell of the vela snr ( figure [ fig : ha ] ) . by considering the geometry of the filaments ( which are probably sheets in projection ) and obtaining electron densities in the region from further optical studies , we expect to be able to make a _ direct _ measurement of the compressed magnetic field in the vela snr shell . the underlying more diffuse linearly polarized emission has some overall corellation with total intensity . however , there are many regions of disagreement . these could be either intrinsic to the source ( i.e.  due to variations within the internal magnetic fields ) or result from depolarization by some intervening more compact region . in the latter case , their counterpart in total intensity is the underlying diffuse emission which forms the majority of the flux density measured from vela x.    the polarization e - vector direction ( figure  [ fig : ppa ] ) is a useful diagnostic of the magnetic field . in this region , the rm is approximately 40 rad  m@xmath4 ( milne 1995 ) , indicating that the magnetic field is generally aligned with the e - vectors plotted , and thus lies along the filaments ( the discrepant e - vectors half - way along the central filament correspond to a region of higher rm ) . we note that the ` wisp ' just to the north - east of the pulsar ( bietenholz , frail , & hankins 1991 ) and the filament extending south do not appear symmetric across the pulsar . further work to make high - resolution corrections for faraday rotation will allow a more detailed interpretation .
SUMMARY:we present high - resolution 1.4 ghz australia telescope compact array polarimetric observations of vela x , the pulsar wind nebula of the vela snr . 
 we find that the linearly polarized emission is only partially correlated with total intensity . 
 there are many depolarization features , some of which are coincident with foreground h@xmath0 filaments . 
 further study of these should provide measurements of the magnetic field in the remnant s shell .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the main goal of our project is to derive a representative sample of nearby isolated galaxies useful for testing galaxy evolution in low density regions of the local universe . at present , there are only two all - sky samples of isolated galaxies : a list of 197 galaxies in the local volume (= lv , @xmath1 10 mpc ) with negative tidal indexes ( karachentsev et al . , 2004 ) , and a catalog of 3227 2mass - selected isolated galaxies ( karachentseva et al . , 2010 = 2mig ) compiled in a similar manner as the catalog of isolated galaxies on the northern sky ( karachentseva , 1973 = kig ) . both the last catalogs have a typical depth of @xmath280 mpc . to fill up the gap between lv and 2mig , we create a new sample of `` local orphan galaxies '' situated in the local supercluster within @xmath1 45 mpc . we tested on isolation @xmath210500 galaxies with radial velocities in the local group rest frame @xmath0 km / s situated at galactic latitudes @xmath3 . first , we cleaned spurious data arrived from automated sky surveys : sdss , 2df , 6df , deep2 , etc . , then determined @xmath4-magnitudes and morphological type if absent . the observed @xmath5- band magnitudes were transformed into @xmath6 ones to derive the @xmath7-band luminosity of the galaxies . we bound the galaxies in systems based on the following algorithm , which tooks into account individual properties of galaxies . thus , two arbitrary galaxies were considered as a pair if their mutual radial velocity @xmath8 and projected separation @xmath9 satisfy the condition of negative total energy : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total mass of the pair . we use also the second condition that the pair components locate inside their `` zero - velocity '' sphere : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble constant . here we determined masses of galaxies from their @xmath7-band luminosity , assuming one and the same ratio @xmath14 with a dimentionless parameter @xmath15 . this quantity corresponds to the mean cosmic ratio of dark - to - luminous matter . we identified all pairs satisfying conditions ( 1)(3 ) and then grouped all pairs with a common component into a single entity . as a result , we created the catalogs of binary galaxies ( karachentsev & makarov , 2008 ) , triple galaxies ( makarov & karachentsev , 2009 ) , and members of groups ( makarov & karachentsev , 2010 ) . this algorithm leaves 46% of galaxies as not clusterized , `` field '' ones . apparently , the higher adopted quantity @xmath16 , the lower fraction of field galaxies . increasing the @xmath16 in 40 times , we derived a fraction of isolated galaxies to be 10% . finally , we applied to them the karachentseva s ( 1973 ) criterion of isolation and obtained the sample of 513 local orphan galaxies ( logs ) . our subsequent spectral observations of neighbouring galaxies around the logs manifest ( melnyk et al . , 2009 ) that most of them turn out to be background objects with a median difference of radial velocities + 9400 km / s regarding to logs . we conclude that our sample amounts to ( 85 - 90)% true , spatially well isolated galaxies . distribution of the isolated galaxies on the sky in equatorial coordinates is shown in fig.1 . the sky distribution looks quite smooth without prominent over- and under - densities in the regions of known clusters / voids . fig.2 presents the distribution of radial velocities of the galaxies within bins of 250 km / s . the shaded histogram is for galaxies detected in iras . the sample of logs is dominated by flat , bulgeless galaxies ( fig.4 ) . about 75% of the sample are late type objects ( t @xmath17sc ) with a peak at t = 8 ( sdm ) . notice that the log galaxies seen in iras have a wider peak at t = 4  6 . being the distance limited ( but not flux - limited ) sample , the log catalog is over - represented by dwarf galaxies in comparison with kig and 2mig samples . fig.5 demonstrates distribution of logs according to their @xmath7-magnitudes and hi- fluxes in the logariphmic scale . the diagonal lines indicate the total gas - to - stellar mass ratio equal to : 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 100 . most of the logs are gas - rich galaxies with the median @xmath18 . the e and s0 galaxies , like their nearest representator ngc 404 , amounts to a minor ( 4% ) fraction of logs . they stand out against normal e and s0 galaxies situated in groups and clusters by a low median luminosity ( @xmath19 ) and the presence of gas and dust . we found among logs about 20 objects having peculiar structures : distorted / asymmetric shape or tails that can be interpreted as a result of recent merging or current interaction with a massive unvisible body ( dark sub - halo ) . such well isolated but peculiar objects deserve closer attention to understand their kinematics and structure .
SUMMARY:we introduce the first entire - sky catalog of the most isolated nearby galaxies with radial velocities @xmath0 km / s . 
 this kind of cosmic `` orphans '' amounts to 4% among all known galaxies within the same velocity range . 
 we describe a criterion of isolation applied to select our sample , the `` local orphan galaxies '' , and discuss their basic optical and hi properties .

 stars : fundamental parameters , techniques : spectroscopic",0.261,0.127,0.185," with the introduction of new telescopes and instruments to the scientific astronomical community , and the rapid increase of sky surveys such as sdss and rave , tremendous amount of spectral data is being acquired on a daily basis and with an increasing rate . therefore , these challenges urged the need of efficient and automated techniques to handle and analyze this huge amount of information . such automated procedures for classification of stars have been discussed recently using different codes and mathematical approaches . as an example , one can mention the methods used to analyze a spectral library described in @xcite . + in this work , we present a dimensionality reduction technique called pca , applied to a huge database of synthetic spectra . pca searches in a high dimensional space for possible correlations , and finds an optimal basis for representing the data in a compact way . due to the high number of spectra in each synthetic database ( @xmath2200000 ) , and the high number of data points in each spectral domain ( @xmath22500 . same as observation , see section 2 ) , such technique is crucial for inverting stellar parameters of observed targets from gaia eso survey . using pca , data can be represented in a fewer number of data points , allowing a fast nearest neighbor(s ) "" search between the observed data set and the synthetic spectra . this study is an extension of @xcite where the h - r domain of application has been extrapolated to stars of types earlier than f , and the training database used in this work is a set of synthetic spectra . the procedure is applied to more than 800 stars , members of the open clusters ngc3293 , ngc6705 , and trumpler14 . the observations are part of the gaia eso public survey and consist of 2 spectral ranges , one samples the h@xmath3 line region [ 4030 - 4200]and the second samples the [ 4400 - 4550](hr5 ) region . these spectra were taken using giraffe / flames spectrograph at a resolution r @xmath4 25000 , and reduced by the ges . balmer lines , due to the broadening caused by the stark s effect , are excellent indicators of effective temperature and surface gravity @xcite . the reason behind studying h@xmath3 in particular is because this line is formed in deep enough atmospheric layers where lte can still be considered as a reasonable assumption . moreover , the hr5 region was chosen since metallic lines ( namely feii , mgii , tiii , ... ) are potentially good indicators of rotational velocity and metallicity . lte model atmospheres were calculated using atlas9 code @xcite and were used as input to the spectrum synthesis code synspec48 @xcite in order to compute a large grid of synthetic line profiles , over the same spectral regions as the observations . spectra were calculated for t@xmath5 between 5000 and 15000 k , gravities between 2.0 and 5.0 cgs , rotational velocities between 0 and 200 @xmath6 , and metalicities between -0.6 and 0.4 dex ( only for the hr5 region , whereas a solar [ fe / h ] was assumed for the @xmath7 region ) , all at a microturbulence of 2 @xmath6 and at a resolution of 25000 . the central idea of principal component analysis is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set in which there are a large number of interrelated variables , while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data set @xcite . pca searches for basis vectors that represent most of the variance in a given database . these vectors ( @xmath8 ) are in fact the eigenvectors of the variance - covariance matrix ( [ var - covar ] ) of the synthetic data set * s*. @xmath9 where @xmath10 being the mean spectrum over all the database . once the basis is obtained ( adopted a set of 12 vectors , i.e @xmath11 ) , the synthetic spectra and each observation ( o ) are projected unto this basis to obtain the projected coefficients ( [ proj synth ] & [ proj obs ] ) @xmath12    @xmath13    then , a standard chi - squared ( [ chi - sqr ] ) is performed in this low dimensional space in order to achieve a fast inversion of stellar parameters of the observed targets . the parameters of the synthetic spectrum having the minimum _ d _ will be considered as the observation fundamental parameters . @xmath14 the observation spectra were radial velocity corrected , and those with low signal - to - noise ratio were filtered out . upon starting the inversion process , the technique showed to be very sensitive to normalization of spectra , thus an iterative  re-""normalization procedure was performed according to @xcite . in general , inversion based on this technique was performed over the selected stars , and the fundamental parameters of the targets were estimated . an example of the nearest neighbor search is given in figures [ hdelta ] and [ met ] . the parameters derived by pca , along with the non -

TEXT: in the study of gaseous halos , most of the recent observational focus has been on nearby normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? relatively little attention has so far been paid to low - luminosity spirals , but an hi halo has been detected by @xcite in the edge - on ugc 7321 . in order to determine the origin of gaseous halos , it is important to pursue the line of investigation into galaxies with very low rates of star formation , where the effects of star formation and accretion may be more easily distinguished .    to address this issue , we have recently performed deep hi observations of the nearby dwarf spiral ngc 4395 . the data were obtained using the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) for a total of @xmath0 . the target was chosen because it is nearby [ @xmath1 ; @xcite ] ; viewed at a moderately face - on inclination [ @xmath2 ; @xcite ] ; isolated ; and has a low optical luminosity , with localized star formation activity ( see fig . [ fig : anomgas]b ) . the data were reduced using standard techniques in the ` miriad ` software package . subsequent analysis was performed using ` gipsy ` . inspection of the hi data cube reveals the presence of a large population of gas clouds at velocities which place them outside of the normal disk rotation . in total , approximately @xmath3 , equivalent to 5% of the total hi mass , is found to be in this component . here , we restrict ourselves to presenting a brief overview of the anomalous gas population ; we defer a more detailed analysis of the individual clouds to a forthcoming paper .    in order to distinguish the gas at anomalous velocities from the gas participating in normal disk rotation , a velocity field was constructed by tracing the peaks of the individual velocity profiles . next , the velocity profiles in each line of sight were shifted by the corresponding value in the velocity field , yielding a ` derotated ' data cube . in this cube , the peak hi emission is located ( by construction ) at @xmath4 . following a visual inspection of the derotated cube , the gas outside of the somewhat conservative velocity range @xmath5 was called anomalous ( cf . the typical hi velocity dispersion , @xmath6 ) .    the global distribution of the anomalous velocity gas identified using the technique described above is displayed in fig . [ fig : anomgas]b . four of the larger gas complexes have been labeled ( a  d ) . complexes b ( @xmath7 ) , c ( @xmath8 ) , and d ( @xmath9 ) appear to be colocated with regions of active star formation , as suggested by the emission in the underlying galex fuv map . complex a ( @xmath10 ) on the other hand , appears to be unassociated with any of the actively star forming regions . it may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion onto the disk of ngc 4395 .
SUMMARY:in recent years , it has become clear that large quantities of gas reside in the halos of many spiral galaxies . whether the presence of this gas is ultimately a consequence of star formation activity in the disk , or accretion from outside of the galaxy , 
 is not yet understood . 
 we present new , deep hi observations of ngc 4395 as part of a continuing observational program to investigate this issue . 
 we have detected a number of gas clouds with masses and sizes similar to milky way hvcs . 
 some of these are in regions without currently ongoing star formation , possibly indicating ongoing gas accretion .

TEXT: given an asymmetric body on a circular orbit , denoting @xmath0 its rotation angle in the plane with respect to the inertial frame , the only possible spin - orbit resonance is the synchronous one @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the mean motion of the orbit . on an keplerian eccentric orbit , wisdom _ et al . _ ( 1984 ) showed that there is a whole family of spin - orbit eccentric resonances , the main ones being @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an integer . in 2013 , correia and robutel showed that in the circular case , the presence of a coorbital companion induced a splitting of the synchronous resonance , forming a family of co - orbital spin - orbit resonances of the form @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the libration frequency in the coorbital resonance . inside this resonance , the difference of the mean anomaly of the two coorbitals , denoted by @xmath7 , librates around a value close to @xmath8 ( around the l4 or l5 lagrangian equilibrium - tadpole configuration ) , around @xmath9 ( encompassing l3 , l4 and l5 - horseshoe configuration ) or @xmath10 ( quasi - satellite ) configuration . we generalize the results of correia and robutel ( 2013 ) from the case of circular co - orbital orbits to eccentric ones . the rotation angle @xmath0 satisfies the differential equation : @xmath11    where @xmath12 are the internal momenta of the body , @xmath13 the polar coordinates of the center of the studied body and @xmath14 its instantaneous semi - major axis . let us consider that the orbit is quasi - periodic . as a consequence , the elliptic elements of the body can be expended in fourier series whose frequencies are the fundamental frequencies of the planetary system . in other words the time - dependent quantity @xmath15 that appears in equation ( [ eq : rot_gene ] ) reads :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are linear combinations with integer coefficients of the fundamental frequencies of the orbital motion ( here @xmath2 and @xmath6 ) and @xmath18 their phases . thus ( [ eq : rot_gene ] ) becomes :    @xmath19    for a keplerian circular orbit , the only spin orbit resonance possible is the synchronous one , since @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . in the general keplerian case we have the spin - orbit eccentric resonances , @xmath24 and the @xmath25 are the hansen coefficients @xmath26 ( see wisdom _ et al . _ ) . for the circular coorbital case , correia and robutel ( 2013 ) showed that a whole family results from the splitting of the synchronous resonance of the form @xmath27 . for small amplitudes of libration around l4 or l5 ( tadpole ) , the width of the resonant island decreases as @xmath28 increases . + in the eccentric coorbital case , each eccentric spin - orbit resonance of the keplerian case splits in resonant multiplets which are centred in @xmath29 . for relatively low amplitude of libration of @xmath7 , the width of the resonant island decreases as @xmath28 increases , see figure [ fig ] ( left ) . but for higher amplitude , especially for horseshoe orbit , the main resonant island may not be located at @xmath30 . in figure [ fig ] ( right ) , the main islands are located at @xmath31 and @xmath32 . these islands overlap , giving rise to chaotic motion for the spin , while the island located at @xmath33 is much thinner .     near the @xmath34 spin - orbit eccentric resonance . ( left ) : @xmath35 - tadpole configuration . ( right ) : @xmath36 horseshoe configuration . [ fig ] , width=510 ] the coorbital spin - orbit resonances populate the phase space between the eccentric resonances . generalised chaotic rotation can be achieved when harmonics of co - orbital spin - orbit resonances overlap each other , which is a different mechanism than the one described by wisdom _ et al . _ ( 1984 ) , where the eccentricity harmonics overlap .
SUMMARY:the presence of a co - orbital companion induces the splitting of the well known keplerian spin - orbit resonances . 
 it leads to chaotic rotation when those resonances overlap .

TEXT: to extract the surface brightness profiles we use rosat / pspc data in the band , omitting point sources . for ngc5044 we also exclude a region 2  south - south - east of the center , where a surface brightness enhancement was detected previously ( d94 ) . to calculate asca / sis arf matrix , we make a 3-dimensional model of the source based on results of rosat profile analysis , using a @xmath1-model , and assuming spherical symmetry . for ngc5846 and ngc4649 the second component of the beta fits is significant . details are described in ffj96 , where it is also shown that our procedure is not affected by variation of rosat / pspc count rate with temperature . analysis of the hardness ratio shows , except for the ngc5044 feature noted , that the temperature distribution is symmetrical around the center . for the spectral fitting of rosat data , we used the band and for the asca / sis data . absorption was taken as the galactic value . the mekal model ( from xspec-9.0 package ) was used in the spectral modeling with abundances from ag89 . the spectrum of the core region ( @xmath21 ) is complex due to the presence of cooling gas , so we present only the temperature . high abundances of si , s and fe in ngc5044 group compared to the two ellipticals , suggest that more of the heavily enriched gas , produced at early epochs , was bound by the deeper group potential than by that of the individual galaxies . a total mass of si , s and fe , inside 300 kpc from ngc5044 center is 0.9 ( 0.41.6 ) , 0.5 ( 0.20.9 ) , 2.9 ( 2.24.7 ) of @xmath3 , respectively with total gas mass of @xmath4 . the mass ratio of fe to si is larger then predicted on the onset of the galactic wind ( mt87 ) and the data favors presence of the `` outflow phase '' in the galactic history . abundances of si , s and fe , observed in ngc4649 and ngc5846 , are determined by snia output and stellar mass loss . while snia supply mainly fe , a ratio of si to fe in stars at the radius involved is not well known . so far , in order to explain the very presence of the optical abundance gradients a shorter time of star formation with increasing radii is assumed ( cdb93 ) , one can argue , that the impact from snii explosions from more massive progenitors prevail at the outer radius , which is characterized by higher si and s to fe ratio ( ww86 ) . nevertheless , an upper limit on snia output can be set by ascribing all the observed fe to the snia . taking snia rate slope s=1.4 and initial time of the `` inflow phase '' equal to 9  gyr ( krm model in c91 ) , an observed fe / fe@xmath5 abundance value of 0.5 corresponds to current sn ia rate values of 0.2 of tammann rate ( for details see ffj96 ) . low mass of fe , observed in ngc4649 , could be ascribed to the effects of ram pressure ablation . anders e. and grevesse n. , 1989 , _ geochimica et cosmochimica acta _ , * 53 * , 197 . 2 . carollo , c. , m. , danziger , i. , j. and buson , l. , 1993 , _ mnras _ , * 265 * , 553 . cdb93 . 3 . ciotti , l. , 1991 , _ ap . j. _ , * 376 * , 380 . 4 . david l. , 1994 , _ ap . j. _ , * 428 * , 544 . 5 . finoguenov , a. forman , w. and jones , c. , 1996 , _ ap . j. _ , submitted . fisher d. , franx m. and illingworth g. , 1995 , _ ap . j. _ , * 448 * , 119 . 7 . matteuci & tornamb , 1987 , _ a&a _ , * 185 * , 51 . 8 . woosley , s. , e. , and weaver , t. , a. , 1986 , _ araa _ , * 24 * , 205 . ww86 .
SUMMARY:we analyze diffuse x - ray emission from ngc4649 , ngc5044 and ngc5846 , combining data from two x - ray observatories , rosat and asca . with asca 
 , we perform a detailed analysis of the x - ray emission which properly accounts for the asca psf and also include a 3-dimensional source model . 
 all three sources exhibit cooling flows in their centers . from the derived abundances of si , s and fe , we conclude that ngc5044 ( a dense group of galaxies ) was able to retain significant amounts of gas during an early galaxy wind phase . 
 fe abundance in ngc5846 ( normal e galaxy ) corresponds to current snia rate of @xmath0 of tammann rate , while low fe mass in ngc4649 ( normal e in the virgo cluster ) could be an environmental effect .

TEXT: the equation of motion of a neutral test body reads in the presence of the @xmath0-field @xmath4 where the geodesic equation is recovered in the case of a non variable @xmath0-field . in the weak fields and low velocity limit , assuming spherical symmetry and circular orbits , the rotational velocity , @xmath5 , at radius @xmath6 is then given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant which would represent the angular momentum per unit mass if the @xmath0-field were not present within the galaxy . assuming that the excitation of the @xmath0-field is very small compared to its vacuum expectation value , @xmath9 , the equation of the @xmath0-field reads in the first approximation @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the source of the @xmath0-field , @xmath12 is the einstein gravitational constant and @xmath13 a universal dimensionless coupling constant . hence , one gets for a static spherical matter distribution @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the mass density of the matter fields other than the @xmath0-field itself . assuming in addition a sufficiently thin disk ( stellar plus gaseous disks ) and a ( quasi - isothermal ) spherical dark halo with mass density such that @xmath16 the static spherical solution of @xmath0 is found proportional to @xmath17 ( up to the vacuum expectation value ) within the galaxy out of the bulge . hence , the rotational velocity reads @xmath18 where the functions @xmath19 are defined as follows @xmath20}.\ ] ] for our purpose , @xmath21 . indeed , this is one of the two necessary conditions for the @xmath0-field mimics a dark matter mass profile ( @xmath22 ) . as can be seen in figure 1 , the greater is the integer @xmath3 , the steepest is the curve @xmath23 versus @xmath24 for @xmath25 and the flatest it is for @xmath26 . hence , the steepest is a rc below the turnover radius , the flatest it should be beyond . figure 2 shows some fits to individual rotation curves ( from the samples of rubin _ et al . _ @xcite , van albada _ @xcite , lake and van gorkom @xcite ) . this is achieved by using the least - squares fit to search the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 that yield the maximum square , @xmath29 , of the correlation coefficient for the relation @xmath30 . as yet , based on the study of a hundred spirals , it is found that @xmath27 is always negative ( this is the other necessary condition for the @xmath0-field mimics a dark matter mass profile ) whereas @xmath31 is always positive . in addition , one gets approximately the following statistics : @xmath32 for @xmath33% of the spirals , @xmath34 for almost a half of them and @xmath35 for @xmath36% of them . figure 3 shows our new result : there is a strong correlation between the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath31 . though displayed here for only fifteen spirals , this remains true for the whole sample of a hundred spirals we have studied hitherto . hence , if a natural theoretical explanation is found in the future , only two independent parameters will be needed to fit the rc with the proposed model one of which is just an integer . it is possible that long range scalar fields external to gravity play a significant role not only at the cosmological level but also at the scale of galaxies or even the solar system @xcite .
SUMMARY:in a previous work @xcite , we have modelled the rotation curves ( rc ) of spiral galaxies by including in the equation of motion dynamical terms from an external real self - interacting scalar field , @xmath0 , minimally coupled to gravity and which respects the equivalence principle in the absence of electromagnetic fields . this model appears to have three free parameters : the turnover radius , @xmath1 , the maximum rotational velocity , @xmath2 , plus a strictly positive integer , @xmath3 . here , the coupling of the @xmath0-field to other kinds of matter is emphasized at the expense of its self - interaction . 
 this reformulation presents the very advantageous possibility that the same potential may be used now for all galaxies .

TEXT: recent surveys with high - resolution uv spectra have shown that mass outflow is common in seyfert 1 galaxies , appearing as blueshifted absorption in more than half of observed objects ( crenshaw et al . detailed studies are needed to determine the physical conditions ( density , ionization structure , total gas column ) and geometry of the absorbers . here , we focus on constraints derived on the absorbers in the uv spectrum of ngc 3783 to demonstrate some techniques that can be used to probe mass outflow in agns . since the background agn light that the absorption features are imprinted on is comprised of distinct emission sources with different flux distributions , sizes , and geometries , the most general treatment of absorption features should take into account the different covering factors associated with each source . the lyman series lines in the averaged stis and _ fuse _ spectra were used to separate the individual covering factors of the continuum and emission line sources in ngc 3783 ( gabel et al . 2003 ) . by incorporating variability of the emission - line profiles , that analysis can be extended to treat _ distinct emission - line regions_. figure 1 shows the c iv , ly@xmath2 , and n v emission - line profiles in both high - state ( solid line ) and low - state ( dotted line ) stis spectra . the low - state profiles have been scaled to match the flux in the high velocity wings of the high - state spectrum . the profiles diverge near line center due to the superposition of a varying broad line region component and a non - varying narrower component ( an intermediate line region , ilr ) . the ilr flux profiles ( dashed lines ) were solved as described in gabel et al . ( 2004 , in preparation ) . figure 2 shows the n v absorption profiles for two normalizations to demonstrate the effect of treating the covering factors of distinct emission components separately . in the left panel , the absorption has been normalized simply by dividing the total observed spectrum by our fit to the continuum plus total emission - line flux , i.e. , the blr + ilr . in the right panel , the ilr flux has first been subtracted out of both the data and emission - line fits , which is equivalent to assuming the ilr is completely unocculted by the absorbers . for each normalization , both the high - state ( top panel ) and low - state ( bottom panel ) spectra are plotted for comparison and the two doublet lines are overlayed , shifted to coincide in radial velocity . this shows that if the covering factors of the emission components are assumed to be the same , then the n v absorption is not saturated and has effective covering factors in the range @xmath3 0.6  0.65 for components 1  3 . the similarity in the absorption depths between the high and low - states ( for both doublet lines ) in the left panel implies there is little change in the column densities for this scenario . conversely , if the ilr is unocculted , the equivalent absorption depths of the two doublet lines indicates the absorption is saturated in both the low and high states in some of the components . this leads to significant differences in interpreting the physical conditions and variability in the absorption . the c iii * @xmath51175 multiplet lines have been used as a density diagnostic for agn absorbers in several studies . however , as pointed out by behar et al . ( 2003 , apj , in press ) , the high densities derived in these studies ( e.g. , gabel et al . 2003 ) were based on calculations of level populations that only treated the @xmath0p@xmath6 level . the @xmath70 and 2 levels have much lower radiative transition probabilities to the ground state and thus are populated at densities that are lower by several orders of magnitude ( bhatia & kastner 1993 ) . we have computed the relative populations of the @xmath0p@xmath8 levels , extending the results of bhatia & kastner ( 1993 ) down to electron temperatures expected for the photoionized uv absorbers seen in agns . collisional excitation and de - excitation and radiative decay between the six lowest terms / levels of the @xmath9 ion were included in our calculations . the top panel of figure 3 shows the c iii*1175 absorption complex in ngc 3783 , with the location of the six multiplet lines marked and identified by the @xmath10 level of the transition . measured column densities for each metastable level are given below the spectrum . the bottom panel shows the computed populations of the metastable levels over a large range in density for @xmath11 16000 , 20000 , and 40000 k ( bottom to top ) . thus , if the absorption is sufficiently narrow to resolve and measure individual lines in the c iii * multiplet , the _ ratios _ of the excited level populations give a very tight constraint on the electron density . for ngc 3783 , the @xmath72 : @xmath70 column density ratios , @xmath12 2.2 , gives @xmath13=3@xmath1410@xmath15  @xmath16 , which is largely insensitive to temperature . combining this with a measurement of the ground state population provides a stringent temperature diagnostic . the full implications of this measurement for the absorbers in ngc 3783 will be given in gabel et al . ( 2004 , in preparation ) .
SUMMARY:results from an analysis of the intrinsic uv absorption in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3783 are presented . 
 we focus on two new results that demonstrate techniques for deriving important constraints on the physical conditions and geometry of the absorbers . 
 first , using variability in the spectrum , the emission - line profile is separated into distinct kinematic components and the effect on the interpretation of covering factors and column densities is demonstrated . 
 second , measurements of the 2s2p @xmath0p metastable levels of c@xmath1 derived from the c iii*1175 - 76 absorption multiplet are presented . 
 new calculations of the metastable level populations are given and shown to provide a powerful diagnostic of the density ( and thus location ) and temperature in an absorber .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: motivated by ideas about quantum gravity , a tremendous amount of efforts over the past decade has gone into testing local lorentz invariance ( lli ) in various regimes @xcite . this paper summarizes the framework allowing one to test lli using high - accuracy astrometric observations . the basic idea is that the usual special - relativistic aberrational formulas used in the corresponding relativistic models is a direct consequence of the lorentz transformations @xcite . a generalization of that aberrational formula obtained with generalized lorentz transformation contains parameters ( similar to the mansouri - sexl ones ) and can be directly used to test lli @xcite . especially the future esa mission gaia @xcite will provide a lot of high - accuracy astrometric data that will be used to make independent tests of lli . the transformation between preferred coordinates @xmath0 and non - preferred ones @xmath1 read @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the velocity of the origin of the system @xmath6 with respect to @xmath0 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are arbitrary functions of @xmath11 . let us consider the relation between directions of light propagation of a given light ray in the preferred frame @xmath12 and that in the non - preferred one @xmath13 . here we consider the same light ray as seen by an observer at rest relative to @xmath14 and another observer ( co - located with the first one ) at rest relative to @xmath6 . taking the differentials along the light ray we have @xmath15 for the preferred frame ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 for the non - preferred frame . the last normalization is needed since the light velocity is not equal to @xmath18 in the non - preferred frames and therefore vector @xmath19 is not an euclidean unit vector . using the coordinate transformations between @xmath0 and @xmath6 given above we get the transformations between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in closed form : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 . in the limit of special relativity one gets the normal special - relativistic aberrational formulas . note that the transformation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 depends only on @xmath25 and does not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath26 . this demonstrates that the aberrational formula tests the same properties of the lorentz transformation as the michelson - morley experiment , that is , the isotropy of light velocity . in practice the aberrational formula entering relativistic models @xcite corrects for aberration due to the velocity of the observer relative to the barycenter of the solar system . the solar system barycentric reference system is not usually assumed to be the preferred system in the sense of the lli . therefore , we have to consider three reference systems : one preferred system @xmath0 , two non - preferred ones  system @xmath6 attached to the barycenter of the solar system , and one more system @xmath27 attached to the observer . the transformation between the preferred and non - preferred coordinates are given above . the only parameter of the transformations is the velocity of the origin of the non - preferred coordinates in the preferred ones . the velocity of the origin of @xmath6 relative to @xmath0 is @xmath5 . the velocity of the origin of @xmath27 relative to @xmath0 is @xmath28 and relative to @xmath6 is @xmath29 . the relation between these three velocities follows from the coordinate transformations and reads ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) @xmath32 finally , denoting @xmath33 the direction of light relative to @xmath27 , combining ( [ s - s])([s - s ] ) written for two non - preferred coordinate systems and using ( [ velocity_90 ] ) one gets @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an orthogonal matrix of the thomas - like precession , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the usual mansouri - sexl parameters ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 in special relativity ) . the thomas precession plays no role here since pure rotation can not be observed in astrometry ( can not be distinguish from the local rotation of the observer ) and the operational reference system attached to the observer is chosen not to rotate with respect to the barycentric reference system . ( [ final ] ) gives the generalized aberrational formula . in addition to the barycentric velocity of the observer @xmath41 , this formula contains the parameter @xmath42 and the velocity of the solar system barycenter relative to the preferred frame @xmath43 . taking the value of @xmath5 from the dipole of the cosmic microwave background , one can determine @xmath42 . alternatively , both @xmath42 and @xmath5 can be determined from astrometric observations . more details on the derivation and interpretation of this formula will be given elsewhere @xcite . this work was partially supported by the bmwi grants 50qg0601 and 50qg0901 awarded by the deutsche zentrum fr luft- und raumfahrt e.v .
SUMMARY:this paper summarizes the analysis of the consequences of the violation of the local lorentz invariance ( lli ) on astrometric observations . 
 we demonstrate that from the point of view of the lli astrometric observations represent an experiment of michelson - morley type . 
 the future high - accuracy astrometric projects ( e.g. , gaia ) will be used to test the lli .

TEXT: echo signals probably exist in the light curves of some sorts of astronomical objects , such as supernovae ( ( * ? ? ? * rest   2005 ) , ( * ? ? ? * krause  2008a ) , ( * ? ? ? * krause  2008b ) ) , x - ray binaries ( ( * ? ? ? * greiner 2001 ) ) and agns ( ( * ? ? ? * perterson 1993 ) ) etc .. if the relative location between a central transmitter and a reflecting object is fixed , then auto - correlation ( ( * ? ? ? * edelson & krolik 1988 ) ) can be used to detect the reflected signal and estimate the distance thereafter . however , in common situation , the nearby reflecting object is always moving ( ( * ? ? ? * perterson 2008 ) ) , therefore , the delay between transmitted and reflected signal is variable , which means the coherence is broken and no echo signals could be detected by auto - correlation .    here , we are going to introduce a method which is called transformed auto - correlation . its aim is to rebuild the coherence and perform cross - correlation between the reflected and transmitted signals . suppose there are only one transmitter and one reflector , and @xmath0 is a transmitted signal , and @xmath1 is the received signal . since astronomical objects are usually far far away , the received light curve is the combination of transmitted and reflected signals , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is reflectance , and @xmath4 is the variable delay which is model dependent , @xmath5 are the parameters of the model .    due to variable delay , a reflected signal will probably loss the coherence to the transmitted signal . in such situation , it is impossible to detect a reflected signal by auto - correlation . a transformation is needed to rebuild the coherence . let s set : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inversion function of @xmath8 in term of @xmath9 .    applying equation . [ eqn2 ] and [ eqn3 ] into equation [ eqn1 ] , then we obtain a transformed received signal : @xmath10    * the definition of transformed auto - correlation is the cross - correlation between received signal @xmath1 and its transformation @xmath11 , i.e. * , @xmath12    if the parameters are correct , then after transformation , the reflected signal is coherent to transmitted signal now , with zero delay . so , only @xmath13 is important . we can calculate all @xmath13 in a given parametric space . the significant peaks of @xmath13 may indicate possible reflectors existed nearby the central transmitter , and the true parameters of these reflectors cab be estimated at the same time . here , an one - dimension simulation is used as an example , where a transmitter is fixed at @xmath14 , and several reflectors are moving or fixed in x axis . the transmitted signal , generated by convolving a gaussian white noise with a gaussian point spread function ( @xmath15 ) , is stochastic and band - limited . the sampling interval is @xmath16 . and 2 , 048 , 000 sampled data are generated . four reflectors are set in the simulation . the model parameters including initial position , velocity and reflectance are listed in table [ tab1 ] , columns 2 - 4 . .the parameters of the reflectors . columns 2 - 4 are values of a model . columns 5 - 7 are estimated values by transformed auto - correlation . [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^ "" , ]     a part of received signal and its auto - correlation function are displayed in figure [ fig1 ] . as shown in the auto - correlation function , although there are four reflectors , only one reflector , which is fixed at position of 0.9 light second , has a fringe . other reflectors have variable delays , so the reflected signals are incoherent to the transmitted signals , and no fringes exist . now , it is able to search the possible reflectors and their parameters by transformed auto - correlation . here , @xmath17 is normalized by @xmath18 . thus the intensity of the peak of a reflector is equal to reflectance @xmath3 . the generated map in parametric space ( initial position and velocity ) , which is called reflectance map , is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . it is clearly seen that all of four reflectors have been detected . the estimated parameters ( initial position , velocity and reflectance ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] , columns 5 - 7 . the standard deviation of the background in reflectance map is about 0.0036 . transformed auto - correlation is able to detect reflected signals when there are constant or variable delays . with a priori reflecting model , the parameters ( such as position , velocity etc .. ) of reflectors can also be estimated .
SUMMARY:a transformed auto - correlation method is presented here , where a received signal is transformed based on a priori reflecting model , and then the transformed signal is cross - correlated to its original one . 
 if the model is correct , after transformation , the reflected signal will be coherent to the transmitted signal , with zero delay . 
 a map of transformed auto - correlation function with zero delay can be generated in a given parametric space . 
 the significant peaks in the map may indicate the possible reflectors nearby the central transmitter . 
 the true values of the parameters of reflectors can be estimated at the same time .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the development of the research in extra - solar planetary systems has been successful continuously for nearly two decades . in addition to the steadily increasing number of newly detected systems , many new aspects of discoveries also make this field extremely exciting . it is the doppler - shift method to make many extra - solar planetary systems known to us . in addition , the method of transit , micro - lensing , and direct imaging also produce fruitful results . in particular , more than 100 extra - solar planets ( exoplanets ) have been found to transit their host stars . moreover , kepler space telescope is revealing many interesting results recently . for example , one of the greatest accomplishment is the discovery of a system with 6 planets . these results really demonstrate the state - of - art power of the transit technique .    among these detected planetary systems , tres3 ( odonovan et al . 2007 ) attracts many attentions due to its strong transit signal and short period comparing with other known systems detected before 2007 . for example , sozzetti et al . ( 2009 ) presented a nice work which combines both spectroscopic and photometric observations of tres3 to obtain the best models for the host star and planet . with an aim to study the possible transit timing variations , gibson et al . ( 2009 ) did nine transit observations .    on the other hand , fressin et al . ( 2010 ) even use spitzer space telescope to monitor tres3 during its secondary eclipse . the most important constraint from their results is to show that orbital eccentricity is almost zero , consistent with a circular orbit assumption . furthermore , the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias ( currently the world s largest optical telescope ) has obtained extremely high - precision narrow - band transit data for the tres3 system ( colon et al . there is almost no deviation for data on the light curve , so this data could give a strong constraint on orbital parameters of exoplanet tres3b . in this project , we monitor the tres3 system by the 0.8 meter telescope of tenagra observatory in arizona , america . in may and june 2010 , five runs of transit observations were done by our group successfully . by the differential photometry performed through the software iraf , five light curves are obtained . in addition to these five light curves , many more data are taken from exoplanet transit database ( etd ) , which is an internet site supported by czech astronomical society ( poddany et al . the tres3b transit data available in colon et al . ( 2010 ) , which employed a 10.4 meter telescope , is also included into our analysis here . etd classifies their data into 5 classes , from quality 1 to 5 based on the flux deviation of light curves . in this analysis , seven quality 1 , fourteen quality 2 , and two quality 3 data are taken to be used . table 1 lists all etd data employed in this paper . .the list of employed etd data [ cols=""<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ] @xmath0 diagram . the full circles are for our tenagra data , squares are for the data from sozzetti et al ( 2009 ) , the full triangle is for 10.4 meter gtc data , and crosses are for etd data . ] @xmath0 diagram . the full circles are for our tenagra data , squares are for the data from sozzetti et al ( 2009 ) , the full triangle is for 10.4 meter gtc data , and crosses are for etd data . ] 1 shows our light curves and best fitting models . 2 presents the @xmath0 diagram , in which the differences between the observed mid transit time , @xmath1 , and the calculated mid transit time of a simple star - planet two - body system , @xmath2 , are plotted . to produce this diagram , we first have to assign the epoch @xmath3 to each transit event . the one with smallest mid transit time , @xmath4 , would be given epoch @xmath5 , and the epochs of all the rest data can be assigned according to their @xmath4 easily . using a linear function , @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is treated as a variable and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are constants , to do chi - square fitting on all the available observational data set of @xmath9 , we can get the best @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the plot @xmath10 as a function of epoch @xmath3 , in which the best @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used for @xmath11 , is the @xmath0 diagram .    note that we do not allow period @xmath7 to change freely , but only vary slightly around the value given in sozzetti et al . ( 2009 ) , and that variation of 0.0002 days is only about 0.3 min . the variation of mid transit times shown in fig . 2 are obviously much larger . in the @xmath0 diagram , the transit timing variation ( ttv ) is about 3 to 4 min . based on this result , if we use a straight line of zero variation to fit those data in @xmath0 diagram , we obtain a reduced @xmath12 to be 8.77 . thus , the assumption with no ttv provides a bad fit to the data , and some level of ttv probably exists .
SUMMARY:through the international collaborators , we recently established a network of existing and working meter - class telescopes to look for planetary transit events . 
 as a first step , we focus on the tres3 system , and conclude that there could be some level of transit timing variations .

TEXT: [ [ section ] ]    the rcs will provide a large sample of optically selected galaxy clusters over the redshift range @xmath3 . clusters are selected using a technique based on locating the red - sequence of early - type galaxies in the cluster core ( gladders & yee 2000a ) . simulations show that the rcs will be complete for clusters of line - of - sight velocity dispersions of 750 km  sec@xmath4 to @xmath5 ( gladders & yee 2000b ) , regardless of the details of the cluster galaxy properties .      the large and well - understood cluster sample from the rcs will be well suited to measuring the evolution of the cluster mass spectrum , @xmath6 , and hence @xmath1 and @xmath2 . individual cluster redshifts can be estimated photometrically from the survey data to an accuracy of @xmath7 ( gladders & yee 2000a ) . masses can also be estimated photometrically , using the @xmath8 richness estimator , which has been shown to be well correlated with velocity dispersion ( yee & lpez - cruz 1999 ) and hence mass . the @xmath8 - mass correlation is currently calibrated to @xmath9 ; once calibration is complete over the entire rcs redshift range the whole survey should yield estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 accurate to @xmath10 - more accurate and independent of current results based on relatively small x - ray selected samples ( e.g. , see henry 2000 and references therein ) .      as a qualitative illustration of the cosmology indicated by the rcs , we have used the rcs selection functions ( gladders & yee 2000a , b ) to integrate out the mass dependence in model predictions of @xmath6 and compared the rcs measure of @xmath11 to predictions from two typical cosmologies . predictions of @xmath6 are made from the standard press - schechter formalism , and multiplied by the rcs selection functions ( expressed in mass and redshift , assuming a cluster with a typical luminosity function shape , galaxy mixture and cluster shape , concentration and size ) . these selection functions tail off to zero probability at a lower mass limit which becomes progressively more massive at higher redshift , limiting the contribution to @xmath6 from lower - mass clusters and groups . the result of these computations , as well as the actual counts from a portion of the rcs , are shown in figure 1 . clearly , and not surprisingly , the low @xmath1 and high @xmath2 model is preferred . regardless of the precise details of the shapes of the modeled curves ( which are dependent on knowing the selection functions ) , the simple abundance of candidates at high redshift in the real data is a strong argument for a low @xmath1 universe .
SUMMARY:the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) is a 100 deg@xmath0 optical survey for high - redshift galaxy clusters . 
 one of the goals of the survey is a measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 via the evolution of the mass spectrum of galaxy clusters . 
 herein we briefly describe how this will initially be done , and also demonstrate the eventual power of the rcs for this type of measurement by a qualitative analysis of the first 1/10th of the survey data .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: collapsing massive stars produce supernovae ( sn ) and are linked to the production of long gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , providing clues to the progenitors and their environments . a key ingredient is the stellar rotation rate , impacting the energy release and outcome of the event following the implosion of the iron core . stellar evolution considerations have shown that it is non - trivial to have rapid rotation , as mass loss and magnetic fields conspire to reduce the pre - sn angular momentum . many studies of neutrino cooled accretion relevant for collapsars have considered specific rotation laws that guarantee by a large margin the formation of a centrifugal disk , because the angular velocity is assumed to be nearly keplerian , or because the absolute value of the angular momentum given implies a circularization radius much larger than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit . however , the distributions of specific angular momentum considered were constant in the equatorial plane . this is unrealistic , as the specific angular momentum increases outwards in the core and envelope , with marked transitions at the boundaries between different shells . here we explore how the distribution of angular momentum as a function of radius can affect the qualitative properties of the accretion flow , and hence the neutrino luminosity , accretion rate and energy release . we pay particular attention to the form and rate of change of rotation in the star with radius , and show that state transitions may in principle produce observable consequences in lgrbs relevant to variability and quiescent periods . woosley & heger s ( 2006 ) 1d pre - sn models were taken as the initial conditions . the correspondent distributions were mapped to two dimensions assuming spherical symmetry , and the iron core was condensed onto a point mass at the origin representing a bh , producing a pseudo - newtonian potential . the evolution is subsequently followed with the same numerical code used in lopez - camara et al ( 2009 ) . the general trend in the distribution of specific angular momentum in pre - sn models is for a rise through the core and envelope . we thus initially considered angular momentum which increased linearly as a function of the stellar radii ( @xmath0 ) . when @xmath0 increased very slowly the result was a quasi - radial inflow ( qri ) ; on the other hand , for a rapidly increasing @xmath0 an accretion disk around the bh was produced . interestingly , cases which increased linearly -but in neither of the two previous regimes- , this is : an intermediate linearly increasing case , allowed momentary appearance of a torus , which was accreted after a delay of @xmath1  s by th bh .    since neighboring shells in pre - sn cores exhibit strong jumps in the @xmath0 superimposed on an increasing function of radius . to explore how this feature affects the flow properties in the collapsing star , we considered a constant background distribution just below the critical value to produce the accretion disk around the bh ( @xmath2 ) , and two narrow spikes with @xmath0 well above @xmath2 . the resulting neutrino luminosity is shown in figure  [ fig : spikes ] . it is clear that multiple spikes in the distribution of specific angular momentum lead to clear transitions between the  quasi - radial "" low-@xmath3 and  disk "" high-@xmath3 state , with durations and delays correlated to the form and normalization of @xmath0 . has a constant background with two superimposed spikes.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the cases when the newly formed accretion disk had more than a third of the mass inside the qri envelope which is falling onto it ( case referred as : @xmath4 ) , then the initial disk absorbs the impact of the infalling shell and survives . thus , when a second spike would approach the still existing disk it would simply add to the preexisting activity , leaving no place to quiescent periods . this is illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : pathways ] . on the other hand , for cases when the disk has less than a third of that which is present inside the qri envelope ( case referred as : @xmath5 ) , then the accretion disk would be destroyed within a dynamical time scale . with this , when a second spike would reach the centrifugal barrier , a new disk would be created , persisting as long as the inflow has sufficient rotation ( upper panel in figure  [ fig : pathways ] ) , and a quiescent epoch would be present . the correspondent time scales can be estimated as the correspondent free fall time for each shell , thus for the case when there is a quiescent period , the initial active period lasts approximately between 1 and 3 second , while the quiescent period lasts from 1 to 15 seconds ( depending on the presn characteristics ) , prior to the main burst . the corresponding neutrino luminosities would be : @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 for the quiescent period , and @xmath6  erg  s@xmath7 for the active periods . we wish to stress that while we have presented the neutrino luminosity as a measure of energy output , it is by no means the only one possible , and should be viewed here as a proxy for central engine activity , like the mass accretion rate ( with which it is closely correlated ) . one could equally use @xmath8 or the power output through magnetic fields as a measure of the ability to drive relativistic outflows . our numerical scheme is geared towards appropriate handling of thermodynamics and the neutrino emission , so it is natural to rely on these properties when making quantitative statements . we note that just as not all lgrbs exhibit this behavior , clearly not all progenitors are capable of producing such state transitions . whether this can power precursor activity is another matter , requiring the initial episode of accretion to create a low density polar funnel in the star , which remains to be studied in the near future .
SUMMARY:even thought a large amount of long gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ) present quiescent periods , their origin remains unclear . in this talk , it is shown how different angular momentum distributions , as a function of the stellar radius ) , can lead to neutrino luminosity variability and the possibility of quiescent epochs in lgrbs .

TEXT: studying the role of phase in quantum mechanics has a long history ( for a review on the phase concepts , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . its importance in today s problems is also apparent . for example , phase in atomic systems has recently been used for storing quantum information @xcite , and phase and photon number measurements have been considered as a basis in some quantum teleportation schemes @xcite . notwithstanding the various phase - dependent effects in quantum physics , phase itself has not been uniquely measured and its very definition as physical quantity has been subject to many disputes . whereas for highly excited ( quasi - classical ) states different approaches give similar results , the various concepts differ in the phase properties of quantum states close to vacuum . therefore the question has been arisen of what are the differences between these approaches and how relevant are they experimentally . in this paper we concentrate on the canonical phase and its relation to @xmath0-parametrized phase - space functions , with special emphasis on the measurability of its exponential moments by `` weighted '' averaging of measured phase space functions . the canonical phase distribution @xmath5 of a radiation field mode ( harmonic oscillator ) prepared in a quantum state described by a density operator @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7 where the fock state expansion of the ( unnormalizable ) phase states @xmath8 reads latexmath:[\ ] ] for small @xmath43 , the dominant contribution to this integral comes from large @xmath90 . we can replace @xmath153 by the asymptotic formula ( [ omegaas ] ) and absorb the prefactors into @xmath198 , @xmath199 . \label{kasint}\ ] ] change of the variable according to @xmath200 yields @xmath201 the integration region of ( [ b9 ] ) can be divided in two parts , @xmath202 @xmath203 and @xmath202 @xmath204 , with @xmath205 @xmath184 @xmath206 . for small @xmath43 , the dominant contribution stems from the latter part where the approximation @xmath207 can be used , and we find that @xmath208 the integral is finite for @xmath43 @xmath46 @xmath23 , and thus @xmath209 the logarithm singularity in the denominator is very weak in comparison to the polynomial one in the numerator . only the polynomial divergence is relevant in eq .

 we show that the sampling kernels exist and are well - behaved for any @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , whereas for @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath2 the kernels diverge in the origin . in spite of 
 that we show that the phase space moments can be sampled with any predefined accuracy from the @xmath4-function measured in the double - homodyne scheme with perfect detectors . 
 we discuss the effect of imperfect detection and address sampling schemes using other measurable phase - space functions . 
 finally , we discuss the problem of sampling the canonical phase distribution itself .

"" the result consists of the fact that an object released through a hole through the center of the earth undergoes simple harmonic motion with a period slightly under 1@xmath0 hours . it is straightforward to show that this result holds true for any chord through the earth ; thus , one may consider a  gravity elevator "" which shuttles between any two points on the earth s surface in approximately 42 minutes . such a path is not the path of minimum time , as can be seen by objects undergoing small oscillations at the surface of the earth . we consider , then , the following problem : determine the path of minimum time ( brachistochrone ) between two points on the surface of a spherical , uniformly distributed mass ; i.e. the  fastest gravity elevator .

TEXT: we have made a spectroscopical follow - up of 10 pdcs lines of sight including 15 clusters . these pdcs clusters ( lubin et al . 1996 ) are optically selected cluster candidates . we have measured about 700 redshifts in 6 nights at cfh with the mos spectrograph . the expected redshift of these clusters is around 0.4 . two areas of the sky are particularly well covered : 4 lines of sight around 9h and 3 lines of sight around 13h . the sampled redshift range is z=[0.,0.9 ] . the first results of this survey show that more than 60% of the candidate clusters are real gravitationally bounded structures with a velocity dispersion ranging from 600 km / s to 1500 km / s . using the 6 best sampled clusters , we have used the same techniques as were were used for the nearby enacs clusters ( adami et al . 1998 ) . we plot the variation of the galaxy normalized velocity dispersion versus the absolute magnitude and the morphological type ( fig 1 : we assume as a first approximation that the em line galaxies are a mix of early and late spirals and that the only absorption line galaxies are a mix of ellipticals and so ) . the open symbols are the results for nearby clusters ( z@xmath00.05 : adami et al . 1998 ) and the filled triangles are for the pdcs clusters ( z@xmath00.4 ) . we see that the two distributions are essentially the same : the evolution of the internal dynamics of the clusters between 0.05 and 0.4 seems to be negligible . at z@xmath00.4 or z@xmath00.05 , the emission line galaxies are an infalling population while the absorption line galaxies seem to be virialized and the galaxies follow the energy equipartition law ( thick line in fig 1 left ) . the conclusion is that the epoch formation of the clusters is probably significantly greater than 0.4 , the clusters continually evolving after with late type galaxies still infalling at low redshifts . the 2 well sampled cop areas ( 9h and 13h ) allow a study of the periodicity along the line of sight . the structures are defined exactly as the enacs ( katgert et al . at 9h , we find a periodicity of 90 @xmath1 2 mpc and at 13h the periodicity is 143 @xmath1 10 mpc . comparing these results with broadhurst et al ( 1990 ) ( 128 mpc in another direction ) , we tentatively conclude that periodicities in the structure distribution are in agreement with the `` web '' representation of the universe and the value of this periodicity depends of the line of sight . adami c. , biviano a. , mazure a. , 1998 , a@xmath2a 331 , 439 broadhurst t. , ellis r. , koo d. , et al . , nature 343 , 726 katgert p. , mazure a. , perea j. , et al . , 1996 , a@xmath2a 310 , 8 lubin l. , postman m. , 1996 , aj 111 , 1795

[ fig1 ] of this note it can be assumed that the first return map on a suitable two - dimensional surface as qualitatively shown by the red line , leads to a two - dimensional map in chaotic regime ) then we have , by any definition of chaotic system ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , _ the existence of infinitely many unstable limit cycles which densely cover the observed chaotic set . moreover , infinitely many homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits exist connecting these unstable limit cycles , which also are dense in the chaotic attractor_. it follows that it is not possible to identify a chaotic system characterized by the non - existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits . -plane of attractor obtained from system ( 3 ) in @xcite for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the red line indicates a suitable plane for the return map . ] the paper @xcite suggests that the presence of chaos is subordinated to the existence of either homoclinic orbits _ of equilibria _ or heteroclinic orbits _ of equilibria_. which is not correct . indeed , the target of identifying a chaotic system characterized by the non - existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits _ to one or more equilibria _ may be correct . however , in our opinion this is not interesting , as it is well known that chaotic attractors may exist also when neither homoclinic nor heteroclinic orbits _ to equilibria _ are present , as it is the case in the classical lorenz system , see , e.g. @xcite . we should emphasize that the existence of a homoclinic orbit of an equilibrium ( or heteroclinic connections between two equilibria ) , under other suitable assumptions , is relevant from a theoretical point of view , as it allows to rigorously prove the existence of chaos and also its persistence under perturbations when the homoclinic ( heteroclinic ) orbit no longer exists .    in the following , we underline the presence of an inaccuracy in the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite . regarding the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite , an incorrect part is related to the unboundedness of the trajectories . consider a vector field @xmath4 belonging to class @xmath5 , @xmath6 the state variable of the system , and @xmath7 the time . assuming the existence of an @xmath8 , such that for at least one @xmath9 we have that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , then ( as pointed out by the authors in eq . ( 2 ) of their paper ) we have to consider the inequality@xmath12*for * @xmath13 which implies that , given a homoclinic or heteroclinic orbit @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 which is compatible with the existence of the orbits itself . then the authors state that the same result in holds also * for * @xmath16 getting divergence for any orbit for @xmath17 . however this is not correct , as for @xmath0 we have ] by a simple integration from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 assuming @xmath21 @xmath22 , by basic properties of definite integrals we have that for @xmath23 @xmath24 from which inequality follows , and for @xmath0 @xmath25 from which we obtain inequality .]@xmath26 in place of . inequality implies that @xmath27 , which does not exclude the existence of homoclinic ( or heteroclinic ) orbits . in this note we provide some arguments showing that the statement of theorem 1 in @xcite is not correct . moreover , we show the presence of a mistake related to the backward integration in the proof of the same theorem . the authors are grateful to g.  i.  bischi and l.  cerboni  baiardi for helpful comments on this note . the usual caveats apply .

TEXT: the mtcc  @xcite took place in the second half of 2006 . it was a first and successful major performance test of a small fraction of the cms detector  @xcite , including the magnet , using cosmic - ray muons as a particle beam , before it was lowered to the experimental cavern . the detector elements participating in the mtcc are shown in figure  [ setup - f1 ]  ( left ) . a cosmic muon detected in cms during the mtcc is displayed in figure  [ setup - f1 ]  ( right ) . the analysis is performed with the dts alone ( sector 10 of wheels yb+1 , yb+2 ) . the runs used in the analysis ( 5 in total ) were taken at b @xmath0 4 t , all with similar dt trigger conditions ( at least mb2+mb3 stations ) . a control sample taken at 0 t is used to make detailed checks of detector performance . simulated samples ( b = 0 t and b = 4 t )  @xcite are used for cross - checks and minor corrections . the events are reconstructed using the standard reconstruction software of the cms experiment . the so - called _ standalone muon reconstruction _ was adapted for dealing with the specific spatial configurations of cosmic muons  @xcite . the reconstruction procedure uses special dt calibration constants  @xcite , in order to account for the random arrival time of cosmic muons . alignment corrections  @xcite , calculated from survey data  @xcite , are applied to the measured hits before the track reconstruction . the analysis strategy is selecting a sample of high quality muons , obtaining the momentum spectra as a function of the muon charge and calculating the charge ratio as a function of the momentum .    in order to select well - reconstructed muons and avoid bias in the relative acceptance for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , caused by trigger configuration ( mb2+mb3 ) , momentum resolution and asymmetric geometrical acceptance due to magnetic field , muons are required to leave hits in at least 3 stations ( triplets / quadruplets ) , and to be fully contained in a left - right symmetric region in sector 10 of wheels yb+1 and yb+2 . figure  [ geometry - f2 ] helps understanding the influence of the geometric acceptance in the relative efficiency for @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the same momentum , entering the detector in symmetric points , and with the same angle , with respect to the vertical axis . the distributions of the momentum of the muon tracks and their azimuthal angle are shown in figure  [ selection_plots - f3 ] for quadruplet muons in the selected sample . good agreement between different runs and simulation is observed . the global cms coordinate system is used , in which the @xmath3 axis goes along the beam - line , that is , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for vertical muons . the charge ratio is computed as the ratio of the @xmath6 spectrum of @xmath1 to that of @xmath2 , as a function of the measured muon momentum ( @xmath6 ) , for all runs and their combination . a correction due to charge confusion and the estimation of systematic uncertainties are performed . the measured muon charge ratio and its statistical uncertainty is displayed in figure  [ charge_ratio_all - f4 ]  ( left ) , for quadruplets , for the individual runs analyzed . the deviations observed among different runs are consistent with statistical fluctuations . the individual systematic uncertainties on the charge ratio measurement are summarized in figure  [ charge_ratio_all - f4 ]  ( right ) , as a function of the measured muon momentum , together with the statistical error . the measurement of the charge ratio using cms data is depicted in figure  [ results - f5 ] as function of the measured muon momentum , together with the results from other experiments  @xcite . given the experimental accuracy , the charge ratio is consistent with being independent of the muon momentum in the range of study . under this assumption , the mean value of the charge ratio , integrated over the muon momentum , is @xmath7 . good agreement with previous measurements within the experimental accuracy is observed . m.  aldaya , p.  garcia - abia , `` measurement of the charge ratio of cosmic muons using cms data '' , cms - note 2008/016 ; + m.  aldaya , `` measurement of the cosmic muon charge ratio using cms data and discovery potential of the standard model higgs boson in the @xmath8 channel '' , phd . thesis cms - ts-2008/013 .
SUMMARY:we have performed the measurement of the cosmic ray muon charge ratio , as a function of the muon momentum , using data collected by the cms experiment , exploiting the capabilities of the muon barrel drift tube ( dt ) chambers . 
 the cosmic muon charge ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of positive- to negative - charge muons . 
 cosmic ray muons result from the interaction of high - energy cosmic - ray particles ( mainly protons and nuclei ) , entering the upper layers of the atmosphere , with air nuclei . since these collisions favour positive meson production 
 , there is an asymmetry in the charge composition and more positive muons are expected . 
 the data samples were collected at the _ magnet test and cosmic challenge _ ( mtcc ) . 
 while the mtcc itself was a crucial milestone in the cms detector construction , not having physics studies among its primary goals , it provided the first opportunity to obtain physics results and test the full analysis chain using real data in cms before the lhc startup , together with a complementary check of the detector performance .

SUMMARY:we select @xmath020000 metal - rich star - forming galaxies from the sdss - dr2 to study the @xmath1 method suggested by pilyugin et al . for metallicity estimates . 
 the oxygen abundances derived from their revised @xmath1 method are @xmath00.19dex lower than those derived from the previous one , and @xmath00.60dex lower than the bayesian abundances obtained by the mpa / jhu group . 
 these abundance discrepancies strongly correlate with the @xmath2 parameter and weakly depend on the log(@xmath3 ) parameter .

 the samples of single pion events were generated with a set of incident energies from 10 gev to 3 tev . 
 the analysis of the simulated data shows that standard calibration using just sampling coefficients for calorimeter parts with different sampling ratio gives nonlinear calorimeter response . 
 non - linear calibration technique was applied for improving calorimeter energy resolution and restoring the calorimeter linearity .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: grb030329 displayed one of the brightest afterglows ever , enabling the study of its evolution for a long time and in detail over a broad range of frequencies , from x - ray to centimetre wavelengths . the afterglow was still visible in radio waves 1100 days after the burst trigger . the optical afterglow was visible for only a couple of weeks until it was obscured by the emerging supernova associated with the grb ; the x - ray afterglow was detected for eight months . thus using our radio observations we can uniquely determine the physical parameters of the blast wave . the broadband afterglow can be modeled by the standard relativistic blast wave model assuming that the jet has two components : one component with a small opening angle that explains the early - time optical and x - ray light curves , and a wider component that carries the bulk of the energy and produces the later - time light curves . because the peak and self - absorption frequency of the broadband spectrum of the second jet are situated in the centimetre regime , this component is naturally best studied at these wave bands . the afterglow of grb030329 was observed with the wsrt and the gmrt from 325  mhz to 8.4  ghz @xcite . we have modeled the light curves we obtained together with earlier reported fluxes from wsrt @xcite , gmrt @xcite , and vla & atca @xcite@xcite . the afterglow was clearly detected at all frequencies except for 325  mhz , where we could only obtain upper limits . grb030329 is the first afterglow to be detected at frequencies below 1  ghz : at 840  mhz with wsrt and even as low as 610  mhz with gmrt . the light curves show the peak of the broadband synchrotron spectrum moving to lower frequencies in time . after 80 days the observed light curves decrease less steeply than expected , which can be explained by a transition into the non - relativistic phase of the blast wave @xcite@xcite@xcite . it was suggested in @xcite that this late - time behaviour could also be explained by a third jet - component with an even wider opening angle than the first two . however , the latter model is excluded by the observations below 1  ghz , which leaves the model with the non - relativistic phase after 80 days as the preferred model for the late - time behaviour of the blast wave @xcite . the low frequency array will be a major new multi - element , interferometric , imaging telescope designed for the 30 - 240  mhz frequency range . lofar will use an array of simple omni - directional antennas . the electronic signals from the antennas are digitised , transported to a central digital processor , and combined in software to emulate a conventional antenna . lofar will have unprecedented sensitivity and resolution at metre wavelengths . this will give the grb community the opportunity to study bright afterglows on even longer timescales than with observations at centimetre wavelengths . we have extrapolated the modeling results of the radio afterglow of grb030329 to the lofar observing range @xcite . the predicted light curves show that grb030329 will be observable in the high band of lofar ( 120 - 240  mhz ) , but not in the low band ( 30 - 80  mhz ) . we also calculated light curves for grb030329 if it were situated at a redshift of 1 instead of 0.16 . the resulting fainter afterglow can also be detected in the high band , although with longer integration times ( on the order of a day instead of an hour ) .
SUMMARY:radio observations of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are essential for our understanding of the physics of relativistic blast waves , as they enable us to follow the evolution of grb explosions much longer than the afterglows in any other wave band . we have performed a three - year monitoring campaign of grb030329 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescopes ( wsrt ) and the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . our observations , combined with observations at other wavelengths , have allowed us to determine the grb blast wave physical parameters , such as the total burst energy and the ambient medium density , as well as investigate the jet nature of the relativistic outflow . 
 further , by modeling the late - time radio light curve of grb030329 , we predict that the low frequency array ( lofar , 30 - 240  mhz ) will be able to observe afterglows of similar grbs , and constrain the physics of the blast wave during its non - relativistic phase .

SUMMARY:the determination of the stellar parameters of m dwarfs is of prime importance in the fields of galactic , stellar and planetary astronomy . 
 m stars are the least studied galactic component regarding their fundamental parameters . yet , they are the most numerous stars in the galaxy and contribute to most of its total ( baryonic ) mass . 
 in particular , we are interested in their metallicity in order to study the star - planet connection and to refine the planetary parameters . as a preliminary result we present a test of the metallicity calibrations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using a new sample of 17 binaries with precise v band photometry .

44,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: it is known that statistical mechanics of point vortices describes surprisingly well the averaged velocity profiles of self - similar mixing layer . after development of statistical mechanics of vortex lines rf1,rf2,rf3,rf4,rf5 , where a vortex does not remain straight and is allowed to take wavy shapes in the course of motion , it appeared a concern that the above - mentioned feature of statistical mechanics of point vortices can be lost in three - dimensional theory . in this paper we show that this is not the case : the averaged velocity profiles predicted by statistical mechanics of point vortices and statistical mechanics of vortex lines are practically indistinguishable for a shear flow between two parallel walls . consider a flow of ideal incompressible fluid between two parallel walls , @xmath0 is the coordinate normal to the walls , @xmath1 , @xmath2 - the distance between the walls . the flow is modeled by motion of a large number of vortices ( fig.1 ) . flow is periodic in @xmath3-direction and @xmath4-direction . in the limit of infinite period in @xmath4-direction , the averaged velocity is parallel to the walls , does not depend on @xmath3 and has the only non - zero component , @xmath5 . assuming that vortices have the same intensity and the total discharge is zero , one obtains for the stream function of the averaged flow , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , the equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the probability to find a vortex at the point @xmath0 , @xmath10 is the total vorticity per unit length in @xmath3-direction , @xmath11 . in the case of point vortices ( fig.1a ) , @xcite @xmath12 and equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) form a closed system of equations . this system can be solved analytically . parameter @xmath13 has the meaning of inverse temperature of vortex motion . it is determined by the initial energy of turbulent flow.in the case of deforming vortex lines ( fig.1b ) , @xmath9 is expressed through the solutions of the eigenvalue problem , @xcite @xmath14    @xmath15 being the minimum eigenvalue . similarly to quantum mechanics , @xmath16 is proportional to the squared solution of the eigenvalue problem : @xmath17 we aim to compare solutions of ( 1),(2 ) and ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) . there is no reason to expect that the velocity profiles found from the two quite different system of equations , ( 1)-(2 ) and ( 1),(3),(4 ) , coincide . nevertheless , this turns out to be the case : the velocity profiles are practically indistinguishable . more precisely : for each @xmath13 from `` @xmath18 problem '' ( 1),(3),(4 ) there is @xmath13 from `` @xmath19 problem '' ( 1)-(2 ) for which the velocity profiles practically coincide . all parameters of the flow can be normalized with respect to the wall velocity : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . the dimension of the normalized @xmath13 is length@xmath29 . the characteristic length , @xmath30 is the width of the mixing layer . non - linear eigenvalue problem ( 1 ) , ( 3),(4 ) was solved numerically using an iteration procedure . at each iteration step the system is being reduced to the sturm - liouville problem , that was solved with the prfer method ( a shooting method based on oscillation @xcite ) . for a given @xmath31 of vortex line flow , @xmath32 one can choose @xmath31 of point vortex flow , @xmath33 in such a way , that the velocity profiles are practically identical . this can be seen , for example , from fig.2 , where the velocity profiles and the stream function are shown for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for which the average velocity profiles coincide form a curve in the plane \{@xmath38 shown in fig.3 . this curve was found in the following way . for each @xmath37 we seek @xmath36 by the minimization of the sum@xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are velocities in @xmath19 and @xmath18 problems , respectively , @xmath42 is the number of the mesh points . the weight coefficients , @xmath43 depend on the density of the mesh and the gradient of the velocity profile @xmath44 . the distance between the walls , @xmath45 was chosen large enough for the solution ( 7 ) to be applicable .      the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 have the meaning of the inverse temperature of two - dimensional and three - dimensional motions . the fact , that the same velocity profile corresponds to different @xmath36 and @xmath37 , indicates that the corresponding temperatures of two - dimensional and three - dimensional motions are different . the temperature of two - dimensional motion has a simple physical meaning : this is an average area bounded by the vortex trajectory . the area has orientation . accordingly , temperature may have both signs . negative temperature of the flow considered corresponds to clockwise pass of the curls of the vortex trajectories @xcite . the physical meaning of temperature of three - dimensional vortex line motion is not known , therefore a physical interpretation of the graph @xmath47 is yet to be established . the result obtained seems an indication that for the shear flow between parallel walls three - dimensionality does not play an important role in formation of the averaged velocity profiles .
SUMMARY:it is shown that the averaged velocity profiles predicted by statistical mechanics of point vortices and statistical mechanics of vortex lines are practically indistinguishable for a shear flow between two parallel walls .

( 1996 ) and attribute the 569 sec period they detected to the binary orbital period . this would make it the shortest orbital period of any known binary system . from the absence of any other x - ray period and the shape of the folded x - ray light curve , they suggest that rx j1914 + 24 is the first double degenerate polar to be discovered , rather than the other possibility that it is an intermediate polar . this paper gives the preliminary results of our search for the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 and our initial analysis of our _ asca _ x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 . cropper etal . ( 1998 ) found that rx j1914 + 24 was closest to star h in the finding chart of motch etal . motch etal . indicate that star h is heavily reddened and not visible in @xmath1 . we therefore obtained a service image of rx j1914 + 24 in @xmath2 taken using ukirt in oct 1997 and found that star h is made up of more than 1 star . follow - up observations were obtained between 2527 june 1998 using the not on la palma . polarimetry observations were made in the @xmath0 band : o and e rays were separated by @xmath3 on the same ccd ( fig [ noti ] ) . photometry of stars in the field was obtained using profile fitting . as the profiles of the stars in the two rays were different , photometry was obtained on each set of images . our not photometry showed that the brightest of the stars making up star ` h ' was the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 . the mean magnitude was @xmath418.2 : @xmath51.6 mag fainter than found by motch etal . ( 1996 ) in june 1993 . there is no evidence that rx j1914 + 24 is significantly circularly polarised . in addition to these @xmath0 band data , @xmath6 band data taken using ukirt the following week have still to be analysed . ( 6,5 ) ( 12,18 . ) cropper etal . ( 1998 ) showed _ rosat _ data from 3 distinct epochs . since then we have obtained another set of _ rosat _ data . we have been able to derive an accurate ephemeris using the start of the increase in x - ray flux to define @xmath7=0.0 ( t@xmath8= hjd 2449258.03941(6 ) + 0.0065902334(4 ) ) . fig [ fold ] shows all our _ rosat _ data folded on this ephemeris . this shows that there has been a gradual decrease in x - ray flux from sept 1993 to oct 1997 ( fig [ fold ] ) . in other respects the light curves are similar in that they all show zero flux for @xmath5 half the 569 sec period . a power spectrum of our @xmath0 band photometry indicates that only one period ( the 569 sec period seen in x - rays ) is present ( fig [ power ] ) . we show the @xmath0 band data folded using all 3 nights of data in the bottom panel of fig [ fold ] using the above ephemeris ( which is sufficiently accurate to match the phasing to within 0.02 cycles ) . the folded data is roughly sinusoidal in shape . interestingly , the peak precedes the x - ray peak by @xmath90.4 . ( 8,8 ) ( -2,-2 . )    ( 8,5 ) ( -4,-32 . ) we obtained a 20ksec observation of rx j1914 + 24 in april 1998 . rx j1914 + 24 was detected only in the sis and only below 1kev . its spectrum ( fig [ asca ] ) could be well fitted with a low temperature ( @xmath1040ev ) blackbody plus interstellar absorption ( n@xmath11 @xmath12 ) . the @xmath13 upper limit to a thermal bremsstrahlung component ( assumed temperature 20kev ) corresponds to a @xmath14 kev flux of @xmath15 erg/@xmath16/s ( @xmath17 erg / s at 100 pc ) . this is typical of a polar . x - ray spectra of intermediate polars are typically much harder . ( 8,7 ) ( -5,-6 . ) we have detected the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 . we find only one period in its @xmath0 band folded optical light curve ( the same 569 sec period we find in x - rays ) . when we folded this data on the 569 sec period we obtain a quasi - sinusoidal modulation offset in phase compared with the x - rays . the fact that we detect only one period , together with the very soft _ asca _ spectrum is further evidence in favour of the interpretation that rx j1914 + 24 is a double degenerate polar . a detailed paper is in preparation .
SUMMARY:cropper etal . presented x - ray observations of rx j1914 + 24 and claimed that the most likely interpretation of their data was that of a double degenerate polar . here 
 we show the preliminary results of optical and further x - ray observations . 
 we identify the optical counterpart and show that no other period apart from the 569 sec period seen in x - rays is identified . 
 although the optical counterpart has no significant polarised flux in the @xmath0 band , our _ asca _ spectrum ( which is typical of a polar ) together with our photometric result adds weight to the conclusion that rx j1914 + 24 is the first double degenerate polar to be discovered .

SUMMARY:detached eclipsing binary star systems are our primary source of measured physical properties of normal stars . 
 i introduce debcat : a catalogue of detached eclipsing binaries with mass and radius measurements to the 2% precision necessary to put useful constraints on theoretical models of stellar evolution . 
 the catalogue was begun in 2006 , as an update of the compilation by andersen ( 1991 ) . 
 it now contains over 170 systems , and new results are added on appearance in the refereed literature . 
 debcat is available at : ` http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/ `
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the interest to the @xmath5 reaction at relativistic energies is mostly due to the possibility to observe the manifestation of the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom and relativistic effects in the simplest bounded system . large amount of the polarization data in deuteron breakup obtained at a zero degree last years can be interpreted from the point of view @xmath6 configurations in the deuteron , where relativistic effects are taken into account by the minimal relativization scheme with the dependence of the deuteron structure on single variable @xmath7 . in addition the considering of multiple scattering is required to obtain the agreement with the data@xcite .    on the other hand , it was shown that @xmath8 data for the pion - free deuteron breakup process @xmath9 in the kinematical region close to that of backward elastic @xmath10 scattering depended on the incident deuteron momentum in addition to @xmath7@xcite . the recent measurements of the tensor analyzing power @xmath0 of deuteron inclusive breakup on nuclear targets @xcite have demonstrated a significant dependence on the transverse secondary proton momentum @xmath11 being plotted at a fixed value of the longitudinal proton momentum . this forces one to suggest that description of this quantity requires an additional independent variable , aside from @xmath7 .    in this report the angular dependence of @xmath0 in deuteron inclusive breakup on hydrogen and carbon at 9 gev / c are presented . the results are compared with the relativistic calculations using paris , cd - bonn and karmanov s deuteron wave functions ( dwfs ) . the experiment has been performed using a tensorially polarized deuteron beam of the dubna synchrophasotron and the sphere setup described elsewhere @xcite . the tensor polarization of the beam has been measured from the asymmetry of protons  from the   deuteron   breakup  on nuclear   targets , @xmath12 , at a zero angle and the momenta @xmath13 @xcite . the vector polarization of the beam has been measured from the asymmetry of quasi - elastic @xmath14 scattering on @xmath15 target @xcite . the tensor and vector polarizations , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , were @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . a slowly extracted deuteron beam with a typical intensity of @xmath22 @xmath23/spill was directed onto a liquid hydrogen target of 30 cm length or onto carbon targets with varied length . the data at 9 gev / c of the deuteron initial momentum were obtained at secondary proton emission angles of 85 , 130 and 160 mr and proton momenta between 4.5 and 7.0 gev / c on hydrogen and carbon . the separation of the protons and inelastically scattered deuterons was done by the measurements of their time - of - flight ( tof ) over a base line of @xmath24 m. the residual background was completely eliminated by the requirement that particles are detected at least in two prompt tof windows . the results on @xmath0 versus the momentum of the secondary protons are presented in fig . [ fig1 ] by the solid and open symbols for carbon and hydrogen targets , respectively . the circles are the data of this experiment , while the triangles represent the data obtained earlier@xcite . the dashed , dash - dotted and solid lines are the relativistic calculations using paris@xcite , cd - bonn@xcite and karmanov@xcite dwfs .              the calculations performed in the framework of the light - front dynamics @xcite with the use of paris and cd - bonn dwfs fail to reproduce the @xmath0 data , while the use of karmanov dwf depending on two internal variables , @xmath7 and @xmath1 , is in a reasonable agreement with the data obtained at 85 mr . @xmath0 data obtained at fixed proton momenta of 6.0 , 6.5 and 7.0  gev / c are plotted versus transverse proton momenta @xmath1 . the symbols and curves are the same as in fig.[fig1 ] . again the use of dwf depending on two variables@xcite gives better agreement with the data .
SUMMARY:the @xmath0 data for deuteron inclusive breakup off hydrogen and carbon at a deuteron momentum of 9.0 gev / c and large @xmath1 of emitted protons are presented . 
 the large values of @xmath0 independent of the target mass reflect the sensitivity of the data to the deuteron spin structure . 
 the data obtained at fixed @xmath2 and plotted versus @xmath3 clearly demonstrate the dependence of the deuteron spin structure at short internucleonic distances on two variables . 
 the data are compared with the calculations using paris , cd - bonn and karmanov s deuteron wave functions .    * tensor analyzing power @xmath0 in deuteron inclusive breakup at large @xmath3 and spin structure of deuteron at short internucleonic distances.@xmath4 *    v.p.ladygin , l.s .

 extremely deep acs imaging of andromeda ( m31 ) showed that its halo is younger than our own , with over half of the halo younger than 11  gyr . 
 hst can only produce pencil - beam samples in each major component of a nearby galaxy due to its small field compared to the size of local group galaxies . 
 future optical space missions such as the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) will provide major advances in the study of star formation histories . 
 snap will map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large","deep color magnitude diagrams extending to the main sequence provide the most direct measure of the detailed star formation history in a stellar population . with large investments of observing time , hst can obtain such data for populations out to 1 mpc , but its field of view is extremely small in comparison to the size of local group galaxies . 
 this limitation severely constrains our understanding of galaxy formation . 
 for example , the largest galaxy in the local group , andromeda , offers an ideal laboratory for studying the formation of large spiral galaxies , but the galaxy shows substructure on a variety of scales , presumably due to its violent merger history . within its remaining lifetime , hst can only sample a few sight - lines through this complex galaxy . 
 in contrast , a wide field imager could provide a map of andromeda s halo , outer disk , and tidal streams , revealing the spatially - dependent star formation history in each structure . the same data would enable many secondary studies , such as the age variation in andromeda s globular cluster system , gigantic samples of variable stars , and microlensing tracers of the galaxy s dark matter distribution .",0.525,0.202,0.251," for more than 50 years @xcite , a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaching the main sequence ( ms ) has been the most direct tool for measuring the star formation history in a stellar population . much of that work focused on the ages of simple stellar populations , such as star clusters , within our own galaxy . by the late 1980s , the leap in sensitivity and photometric precision offered by the widespread use of ccds , coupled with advances in stellar evolution models , allowed accurate estimates for the ages of galactic globular clusters @xcite . in the 1990s , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the subsequent installation of the wide field planetary camera 2 enabled the measurement of star formation histories in more complicated populations throughout the local group . beyond the closest satellites of the milky way , these studies focused on the brighter and younger populations in dwarf galaxies @xcite . in 2001 , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was installed on hst , and its dramatic improvements in sensitivity , field of view , and sampling enabled dating of the oldest populations out to the edge of the local group . extremely deep acs imaging of andromeda ( m31 ) showed that its halo is surprisingly younger than our own @xcite , with over half of the halo younger than 11  gyr , and with 30% of the population at intermediate ages of 68  gyr ( figure 1 ) . the data from such long exposures are also useful for studying transient phenomena ( e.g. , microlensing , supernovae ) and variable stars @xcite . soon two more deep fields will be obtained in m31 s outer disk and giant tidal stream . because the acs field is extremely small compared to the size of local group galaxies ( e.g. , the m31 halo is several degrees across ) , hst can only produce pencil - beam samples in each major component of a nearby galaxy . m31 s complex substructure , seen in maps of its bright giant stars @xcite , can not be sampled at this depth within the remaining hst lifetime . there are two near - term avenues for major advances in the study of star formation histories utilizing upcoming optical space missions ( figure 2 ) : the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) . the james webb space telescope will also make progress , but its infrared bands do not provide as good a temperature lever for ms stars .    as an optical telescope with the sensitivity and sampling of hst , but with a much larger field of view , snap could map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large galaxies like m31 and m33 . the observing program might consist of two stages : an exploratory stage , where shallow tiles across the galaxy provide secondary age diagnostics on the red giant branch and horizontal branch , and a deep followup stage , providing direct age diagnostics via ms photometry , sampling at a @xmath020% fill factor . current plans envision 0.1@xmath1 pixels ;

TEXT: one of the techniques to register ultra - high energy extensive air showers ( eas ) is measuring strength of radio pulse by antennas . unlike traditional techniques , including optic measurements of air shower propagation radio technique can operate in any atmospheric condition except during thunderstorm conditions for whole observation period , which dramatically increases effective time of air showers registration . it is easier to use and much cheaper than other ground detectors in existing air showers array .    the yakutsk array measured three components of air shower : the total charged component , the muon component and cherenkov radiation . from these components using average lateral distribution function ( ldf ) the integral characteristics of air shower , the total number of charged particles , the total number of muons and full flux of cherenkov light at the sea level are recovered . all these shower characteristics are used for further model - free air shower energy estimation as shown in [ 1 ] . cherenkov light registered at the sea level moreover is used to recover air shower longitudinal distribution and it characteristics , cascade curve and depth of maximum x@xmath0 [ 2 , 3 ] . using this , in future is possible to find a relation between the characteristics of the radio emission and characteristics of the eas , including slope of the radio emission ldf with depth of maximum , as shown in [ 4 ] . for the season 2008 - 2012 were recorded 600 air shower events with radio emission . showers energy were above 3@xmath110@xmath2 ev , and zenith angle @xmath3 @xmath4 70@xmath5 . for further analysis were selected only 421 showers , appropriate selection criteria of this paper . therefore , for analysis at the yakutsk array we use following criteria :    1 . the shower selected if adc prehistory contains radio pulse with amplitude 5 times more than noise level and pulse is localized within time gate equal to delay of `` master '' from small or large arrays . 2 . extensive air shower axis must be within perimeter of central array with radius 600 m. zenith angle @xmath3 @xmath4 35@xmath5 . azimuth angle @xmath6 chosen such a way as to exclude influence of polarization effect . that is , the amplitude of the crossed antennas were equal or were nt go beyond limit ( 3 - 5 ) @xmath7 . amplitude is calculated by formula [ 5 ] : @xmath8s_{j}[t]\right| }      \end{aligned}\ ] ]    these criteria were used to derive eas radio emission lateral distribution function ( ldf ) .    with selected events , we plotted dependence of maximum amplitude of radio pulse from distance between air shower axis and antenna ( fig . @xmath9 ) for three intervals of energy . energy was determined by cherenkov detectors data [ 1 ] . analytical expression of experimental data is given by function :    10@xmath10 ev , 4.38@xmath110@xmath10 ev  1.32@xmath110@xmath11 ev , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    @xmath12    each curve was fitted separately . then we found the dependence of the coefficients from energy and zenith angle ( in the case of the yakutsk array zenith angle is equal to geomagnetic angle )    @xmath13    fig . @xmath9 shows that slope of average ldf changes with the distance . at large distances from shower axis , radio emission attenuates slowly . from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) was derived the formula that describes eas radio emission ldf , which includes dependence form from energy and zenith angle :    @xmath14    where , @xmath3  zenith angle , r  distance to antenna , e@xmath15  primary particle energy .    by analogy with [ 4 ] and using showers , where the radio emission was measured at the same time , we carried out a comparison of the slope of ldf with depth of maximum of shower x@xmath0 . @xmath16 shows the slope of radio emission ldf from xmax . depth of maximum determined from cherenkov detectors measurements of the yakutsk array and slopes determined from ratio of amplitudes at distances 80 and 200 m for three energies : 1.73@xmath110@xmath10 ev , 4.38@xmath110@xmath10 ev and 1.32@xmath110@xmath11 ev . @xmath16 implies that slope of air shower radio ldf correlates well with x@xmath0 , which in future can be used for analysis of longitudinal distribution of individual showers and subsequently for an independent estimation of cosmic rays mass composition . measurements of the yakutsk array showed : a ) there is correlation between measured maximum amplitude of radio signal with air shower energy obtained from measurements of main components of eas at observation level . this follows from joint consideration of radio signal value and air shower energy ; b ) the form of lateral distribution radio signal depends on depth of air shower maximum x@xmath0 ( fig . @xmath16 ) . s. p. knurenko , d. s. borschevsky , z. e. petrov , i. s. petrov . spie 8696 , eighteenth international symposium on atmospheric and ocean optics : atmospheric physics , 86960q ( november 27 , 2012 ) ; doi:10.1117/12.2008640

SUMMARY:using 100ks of xmm - newton data on the lockman hole , we show how the x - ray background spectral paradox is being resolved . 
 we find the summed spectra of the type i agn , type ii agn , and the unidentified objects . 
 we conclude that the hard slope of the xrb is caused predominantly by latter sources , i.e. the type ii agn and unidentified objects .

[ cols=""^,^ "" , ]     on the other side , solutions to rarita - schwinger equation in ads space are more difficult to get , but its spectrum is similar to the dirac case , as you can see for example in ref . @xcite . as is possible to see in fig 2 , again the results are somewhat high , but using @xmath1 , adjusted to @xmath2 resonances gives better results . the holographical model discussed here allowed us to obtain hadronic spectra with regge behavior , not only for the integer spin case , but also for spins 1/2 and 3/2 , and also to calculate masses for exotics . in order to do this we considered anomalous dimensions for operators that create hadrons , and the dilaton that was used has a form suggested by einstein s equations , corresponding to the ads metric . this two traits allowed the model to reproduce regge spectra in all cases considered , and therefore the model can describe hadronic masses in a unified phenomenological model . j. polchinski and m. j. strassler , phys . lett 88 , 031601 ( 2002 ) ; r. a. janik and r. peschanski , nucl . phys b565 , 193 ( 2000 ) ; s. j. brodsky and g. f. de tramond , phys . lett b582 , 211 ( 2004):e . levin , j. miller , b. kopeliovich and i. schmidt , e - print : arxiv:0811.3586 [ hep - ph ]    s. j. brodsky and g. f. de tramond , phys . lett 94 , 201601 ( 2005 ) ; a. karch , e. katz , d. t. son and m. a. stephanov , phys . rev d74 , 015005 ( 2006 ) ; s. j. brodsky and g. f. de tramond , arxiv : 0802.0514 v1 [ hep - ph ] . l. da rol and a. pomarol , nucl . phys b721 , 79 ( 2005);j . erlich , e. katz , d. t. son and m. a. stephanov , phys . lett 95 , 261602 ( 2005 ) ; p.  colangelo , f.  de fazio , f.  giannuzzi , f.  jugeau and s.  nicotri , phys . d * 78 * , 055009 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0807.1054 [ hep - ph ] ] . s.  j.  brodsky and g.  f.  de teramond , phys . * 96 * , 201601 ( 2006 ) [ arxiv : hep - ph/0602252 ] ; s.  j.  brodsky and g.  f.  de teramond , phys . d * 77 * , 056007 ( 2008 ) [ arxiv:0707.3859 [ hep - ph ] ] ; a.  vega , i.  schmidt , t.  branz , t.  gutsche and v.  e.  lyubovitskij , phys . d * 80 * , 055014 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0906.1220 [ hep - ph ] ] . i. kirsch , jhep09 ( 2006 ) 052 . w. de paula , t. frederico , h. forkel and m. beyer , phys . d * 79 * , 075019 ( 2009 ) [ arxiv:0806.3830 [ hep - ph ] ] ; u. gursoy and e. kiritsis , jhep0802 : 032 , 2008 ; u. gursoy , e. kiritsis and f. nitti , jhep0802 : 019 , 2008 .max_lengthrequest_suffix"

TEXT: a proposed pathway for the generation of type ia supernovae ( sn ) is via the merger of two white dwarfs ( wds ) , the so - called double - degenerate channel ( ( * ? ? ? * webbink 1984 ) ) . until recently , the sample of known double degenerates was limited to older wds . however , recent work has shown that a few planetary nebula central stars ( cspn ) are likely ( pre-)double - degenerate binaries . in this work , we use 1-d ( cloudy ; ( * ? ? ? * ferland et al . 1998 ) ) and 3-d ( mocassin ; ( * ? ? ? * ercolano et al . 2003 ) ) photoionization codes to infer the nature of the central binary stars in two planetary nebulae ( pne ) . constraints on their component masses will show if the total mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit . if these systems are short - period binaries , they are potential type ia sn progenitors . the bright eskimo nebula ( ngc 2392 ) has a conspicuous hydrogen - rich cspn with @xmath3 = 43,000 k ( ( * ? ? ? * mndez et al . 2011 ) ) . however , the surrounding pn has emission lines of high excitation , such as he ii @xmath44686 and [ ne v ] @xmath43426 , which can not be produced by the visible star . an additional hot ionizing source must be present . to deduce the properties of the companion , we model the pn using mocassin . for the model inputs , we used the line intensities from ( * ? ? ? * pottasch et al . ( 2008 ) ) , and adopt a distance of 1.8kpc . following ( * ? ? ? * odell et al . ( 1990 ) ) , the model has a heterogeneous density distribution , with @xmath5 = 3000 and 1300 @xmath6 for the inner prolate spheroid and outer spherical zone , respectively ( see fig . 1 in ( * ? ? * danehkar et al . 2011 ) ) . our model outputs agree well with the observations ( see table  1 ) , and we find that a hot , massive wd with @xmath7kk is a plausible source of the extra uv photons . the wd mass from evolutionary tracks is close to 1  @xmath1 , so the total mass may exceed the chandrasekhar limit . if the system is a close binary ( ( * ? ? ? * mndez et al . 2011 ) ) , the stars may merge within a hubble time , making it a potential sn ia progenitor . it is interesting to note that ( * ? ? ? * guerrero et al . ( 2011 ) ) have found the cspn to be a hard x - ray source . which may point to mass transfer between the components . further observations of this unusual pn and its central star are urged . similarly to the eskimo , spectra show that the excitation class of this elliptical pn is too high to be the result of photoionization by the observed cspn . this was recently found to be a short - period binary with @xmath8 = 0.528 days ( ( * ? ? ? * hillwig et al . 2010 ) ) . based on light - curve modeling , the system consists of a relatively cool o7 star ( @xmath9kk ) and an unseen companion , which is a hot wd with @xmath10kk . the luminosity and mass of the components , the pn distance , and the nebular abundances were independently determined here by interpolating from a grid of cloudy models . the distance is 2.0 @xmath11 0.5 kpc , and the luminosities and masses of the components are given in table  1 . despite the short orbital period , the total mass is too low for the system to produce a sn ia . lastly , we find that the pn progenitor had sub - solar metallicity , with [ o / h ] @xmath12 dex . .best - fit parameters ( left ) and observations versus model outputs ( right ) .

SUMMARY:we use photoionization modeling to assess the binary nature of the central stars of ngc 2392 and ngc 6026 . 
 if they are close binaries , they are potential type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) progenitors if the total mass exceeds the chandrasekhar limit . we show that the nucleus of ngc 2392 likely has a hot , massive ( @xmath01@xmath1 ) white dwarf companion , and a total mass of @xmath21.6@xmath1 , making it an especially interesting system . 
 the binary mass in ngc 6026 is less , @xmath21.1@xmath1 . even though its orbital period is short , it is not considered to be a sn  ia progenitor .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( also know as helium stars ) are the likely progenitors of grbs . the more massive wr stars produce black holes at core - collapse and their radius is small enough for the relativistic jets to reach the stellar surface and produce the prompt grb emission . wr stars have dense high - velocity winds that produce large stellar - wind bubbles through which the afterglow jet will propagate after the grb event . observations of afterglows agree with models of the stellar wind bubbles ( e.g. eldridge et al.(2006 ) and reference therein ) . a problem remains that the free - wind region of the bubbles , where the density scales as @xmath0 , is always large and should be observed in every grb afterglow . however for many grb afterglows a constant density medium ( cdm ) has been inferred from afterglow observations . there is some uncertainty in estimating the circumburst environment but cdms tend to be preferred . van marle et al . ( 2006 ) have investigated how to move a cdm into closer proximity with the progenitor and found a number of possible effects such as stellar motion through the ism . however there is another possibility , the grb progenitors must be rapidly rotating at the time of core collapse to ensure that the material around the forming black hole has enough angular momentum to produce an accretion disk . stellar rotation can produce a strong effect on the stellar - wind bubble that has not been considered . ignace et al . ( 1996 ) investigated the effect of rotation on stellar winds for various stellar types . they found that even moderate rotation of a wr star will effect the density of the wind at different latitudes on the stellar surface . this will effect the position of the wind termination shock by varying the ram pressure ( @xmath1 ) with latitude . their work is supported by observations of wolf - rayet binary cx cephei . the light from the star is strongly polarised ( approximately 4 percent ) which was used to infer that the wr star is rapidly rotating producing a equator - to - pole wind density ratio of 5 ( villar - sbaffi et al . using the results of ignace et al . ( 1996 ) we produced models of the distorted wind bubbles modifying the code used by eldridge et al . density profiles through two simulations are shown in figure 1 . we see that if rotation reduces the polar wind density the distance to the cdm is reduced . therefore in the rotating case the afterglow jet is more likely to inferred to be propagating through a cdm . how close the cdm can move to the progenitor depends on how quickly the wind is accelerated and the rate of rotation . for a standard wr star wind the predictions in figure 1 are the result of a rotation rate of 45 percent of the stellar break - up velocity . we are currently working to determine how this effect changes for different wr stars . such calculations are complicated as wr winds are optically thick so common assumptions of line driven winds can not be applied . it is important to note that if the star is rotating close to break - up velocity then it may become highly distorted and the mass - loss geometry may become very different from that shown here ( owocki , cranmer & gayley 1996 ) .
SUMMARY:gamma - ray bursts ; massive stars ; stellar - wind bubbles . 
 if wolf - rayet stars are the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , they must rotate rapidly to produce the grb . 
 this rotation may effect their stellar - wind bubbles and possibly explain why so many grb afterglows occur in a constant density medium .

[ f : f1 ]    some 15% of sources from the vcs lists were observed previously in astrometric / geodetic programs . analysis of the differences between the vcs catalogues and goddard gsf2003c catalogue allowed us to assess the error model . as a result of this analysis the formal uncertainties were inflated in this way : @xmath2    @xmath3 and @xmath4 are declination dependent :     @xmath5 + ( deg ) & ( mas ) & ( mas ) + @xmath6 $ ] & 0.3 & 0.3 + @xmath7 $ ] & 0.3 & 0.6 + @xmath8 $ ] & 0.6 & 1.1 + amplitude and initial phase calibration was done by aips software . sources were imaged by the caltech difmap package . some 70% of sources were imaged automatically , the others were imaged manually . the typical image rms is 23 mjy , with dynamic range 30:1 or better .
SUMMARY:positions and maps of 1608 new compact sources were obtained in twelve sessions observed during 19942002 at the vlba network at 8.4/2.3 ghz .

TEXT: the quest for high  redshift ( @xmath2 ) clusters of galaxies has recently received a lot of well deserved attention . the physical mechanisms that rule galactic evolution still lack a clear understanding , and clusters at different redshifts are privileged observational targets to develop related studies . moreover , knowing the number density of these systems , as well as their epoch of formation , provides crucial ways of testing different theoretical cosmological models put forward in the literature ( see _ eg _ bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) . however , finding clusters at cosmologically interesting look - back times ( @xmath3 ) , not to mention defining a complete sample , is a time consuming and difficult task . successful attempts to gather optically selected samples were made by postman et al ( 1996 ; p96 onwards ) in the northern hemisphere . prompted by the release of the eis data , we developed an algorithm - see lazzati et al ( 1998 ) , lobo et al ( 1998 ) - to be applied to catalogues of galaxy positions and magnitudes . one of its main advantages is that the spatial and luminosity part of the filter are run separately on the catalogue , with no assumption on the typical size or typical @xmath4 for clusters , as these parameters intervene in our algorithm only as typical angular scale - a set of gaussian @xmath5 s - and typical apparent magnitude @xmath6 . in this way , the significance of a cluster detection is always enhanced , by combining the most probable @xmath6 with the most probable angular size . moreover , a local background is also used , allowing us to adapt well to and overcome the hazards of inhomogeneous data sets ( the quality of eis patch a data was somewhat affected by el ni~ no ) . extensive simulations using directly the eis data allowed us to obtain completeness and contamination rates that do seem advantageous relatively to the respective ones obtained with the p96 algorithm ( see the next section ) . running our new algorithm on the eis data produced a new `` robust '' set of cluster candidates up to @xmath1 ( as estimated _ via _ the respective @xmath6 ) , namely @xmath7 for patch a ( @xmath8 sq . degs . ) and @xmath9 for patch b ( @xmath10 sq . degs . ) . out of these , nearly half are not present in the list of candidates obtained from the same data using the p96 algorithm ( olsen et al 1999 ; see lobo et al 1998 ) . the false detection rate we estimated is of @xmath11 spurious candidates per square degree once the threshold is set at @xmath12 ( our final adopted detection threshold ) . for comparison , p96 report an estimated contamination rate for their final catalogue of at most @xmath13 in their @xmath14 square degree area . as for completeness , setting the detection threshold at @xmath12 still allows us to achieve a completeness of @xmath15 until @xmath16 for richness 2 , coma - like clusters . some of our cluster candidates have already been followed - up in multi - waveband bvri imaging to estimate photometric redshifts and to get a handle on cluster members and determine their color properties . + the complete list of candidates , finding charts and further details will be presented in lobo et al ( 1999 , in preparation ) . three of our highest estimated redshift ( @xmath17 ) cluster candidates were selected for spectroscopic observations carried out with the fors / vlt last september . the data we obtained ( aimed at reaching down to @xmath18 , and as far as the cluster virial radius ) allowed us to confirm their `` cluster identity '' and to secure their redshifts as being @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . once these data are completed , they will form a small but homogeneous sample of clusters of very similar richness and redshift , that can be used to provide us with the absolute normalization of the bright end of the luminosity function in high@xmath22 clusters , an important constraint for theories of structure formation and evolution . we will also explore the dynamics and morphological evolution of member galaxies at a redshift associated to the assembling of large galaxy clusters . renzini a. , da costa l. 1997 , the messenger , 87 , 23 bahcall n. , fan x. , cen r. 1997 , , 485 , l53 postman m. et al 1996 , , 111 , 615 lazzati d. et al 1998 , in proceedings of the xivth iap meeting , wide field surveys in cosmology , eds . s. colombi & y. mellier , 400 lobo c. et al 1998 , astro - ph/9809162 olsen et al 1999 , , 345 , 363 olsen et al 1999 , , 345 , 681

TEXT: new possibilities for neutron - star ( ns ) and gamma - ray burst ( grb ) research are emerging from radio interferometry using large numbers of low - cost receivers , such as in the currently operational ata @xcite and the planned ska @xcite . we here investigate the prospects of finding neutron stars  be it classical radio pulsars , axps or rrats  and grbs with lofar ( for details see @xcite ) . besides these the _ transients key science project _ aims to study all variable and transient lofar sources , including jet sources such as agn or supernovae as well as accreting white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar - mass black holes . sources will also include exo- or solar - system planets , flare stars , brown dwarfs , and active binaries ; as well as short radio bursts , generally unexplored parameter space , eti and the unknown ( for an overview , see * ? ? ? with the first stations operational and the first pulsars detected lofar is on track to officially start operation early 2010 . using two different types of dipoles , lofar can observe in a low and a high band that range from 30 - 80mhz and 110 - 240mhz respectively . the sensitivity using the high - band antenna ( hba ) is several times that of the low - band antenna ( lba ) so we will here briefly outline the hba characteristics . sets of 4x4 dipoles form an antenna tile. tiles are grouped together in stations that increase in collecting area with their distance from the array center . the innermost 6 split stations are are packed tightly in a superstation. spread over the 2-km core there are 12 more split hba stations . next are 18 dutch remote , while the @xmath08 large international stations are spread over europe . signals from these stations are next sent to the central processor supercomputer for correlation , addition and/or different types of beam forming . in @xcite we have investigated the number and type of radio pulsars that will be discovered with lofar . we consider different search strategies ( such as  coherent  versus incoherent * ) for the galaxy , for globular clusters and for other galaxies . we show that a 25-day all - sky galactic survey can find approximately 900 new pulsars , probing the local pulsar population to a very deep luminosity limit . for targets of smaller angular size such as globular clusters and galaxies more lofar stations can be combined coherently , to make use of the full sensitivity . searches of nearby northern - sky globular clusters can find new low luminosity millisecond pulsars ( eg .  several millisecond pulsars in a 10-hour observation of m15 ) . giant pulses from crab - like extragalactic pulsars can be detected out to over a mpc . this survey will produce a complete local census of radio - emitting neutron stars , such as radio pulsars and axps and with the long pointings possible it is particularly sensitive to transient - type neutron stars like rrats @xcite and intermittent pulsars @xcite  for an overview see @xcite . this census provides insight into neutron birth rates and properties , hence elucidating core collapse energetics and asymmetry , the velocities and spatial distribution of pulsars , and the physics of neutron stars in general . prompt emission and ( orphan ) afterglows from grbs can be picked up in one of several transients ksp surveys : in the high time resolution ( pulsar , exoplanet ) dedicated all - sky survey ; in the piggyback survey that will search all lofar observations to look for variable and transient sources , by comparing with previous images of that region of sky ; in targeted deep high - resolution observations ( cf . grb 030329 * ? ? ? * ) triggered by other facilities such as orbiting x - ray/@xmath1-ray observatories , groundbased optical telescopes ; or in the dedicated radio sky monitor , rapid regular scans of a large fraction of the entire northern sky that we will describe in some more detail below . the rsm could operate in several modes . rapid all - sky monitoring mode : fast shallow ( @xmath01mjy ) hemispherical surveys could be performed on short timescales ( @xmath01min pointings , daily ) in order to survey for rapid transients . zenith monitoring mode : staring at the zenith optimises the sensitivity and beam stability of the telescope , whilst providing a sizeable and repeatedly monitored part of the sky . galactic plane monitoring : most of the northern galactic plane is visible from lofar and could be monitored for galactic transients . every second calibrated images are produced of each beam . these are accumulated over logarithmic intervals to integrated maps , and analysed in real - time to check for flux changes of known objects or for new transients . high - confidence events will initiate lofar follow up observations as well as trigger alerts directly to partner observatories , and to the broader community .
SUMMARY:lofar , the low frequency array , is an innovative new radio telescope currently under construction in the netherlands . with its continuous monitoring of the radio sky 
 we expect lofar will detect many new transient events , including grb afterglows and pulsating / single - burst neutron stars . 
 we here describe all - sky surveys ranging from a time resolution of microseconds to a cadence span of years .

TEXT: the evolution of a star cluster depends critically on its ability or failure to retain its mass . dynamical processes cause mass segregation and preferential escape of low - mass stars from clusters . besides losing entire stars , clusters also lose mass due to envelope mass loss from its member stars , exacerbating cluster dispersal . we here briefly discuss the importance for the long - term cluster evolution of the mass loss from intermediate - mass stars in the mass range 0.88 m@xmath0 . we searched for circumstellar dust around giants in clusters of a wide range in ages in the smc and lmc @xcite . such dusty ` superwinds ' cause an infrared excess . the spectral energy distributions were modelled to derive mass - loss rates . we compared the integrated mass - loss rate with the total cluster mass . the timescale for a cluster to lose its mass through dusty superwinds is found to be not much longer than the cluster age . this is true for young clusters ( @xmath1 yr ) as well as older clusters ( @xmath2 yr ) . hence , stellar mass loss can be important throughout the evolution of a cluster . stellar mass loss continuously replenishes the intra - cluster medium . detecting this material has proven difficult , suggesting efficient removal during the journey through the galactic plane and halo . nonetheless , we recently detected 0.3 m@xmath0 of neutral hydrogen in the intra - cluster medium of the galactic globular cluster m15 @xcite . despite its low metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath3 , dust has also been detected in this cluster @xcite . mass loss from a star cluster can be written as @xmath4 if the mass loss is slow compared to the relaxation timescale , the process is quasistatic . applying the virial theorem , the cluster radius would increase as @xmath5 for the case of stellar escape due to cluster dynamics : @xmath6 . relaxation timescales for globular clusters are typically @xmath7 gyr . hence , after 10 gyr the radius would have increased by @xmath8 per cent .    for a stellar initial mass function @xmath9 with @xmath10 , stars in the mass range 0.88 m@xmath0 contribute at least as much to the initial cluster mass as lower - mass stars . in galactic globular clusters , with ages @xmath11 gyr , these intermediate - mass stars have all lost significant mass on the asymptotic giant branch . assuming all this mass is removed from the cluster , we estimate that @xmath12 . hence , the radius will have grown by a factor @xmath13 over the last 10 gyr . boyer , m.l . , woodward , c.e . , van loon , j.th . , et al .  2006 , , 132 , 1415 evans , a. , stickel , m. , van loon , j.th . , et al . 2003 , , 408 , l9 van loon , j.th . , marshall , j.r . , zijlstra , a.a . 2005 , , 442 , 597 van loon , j.th . , stanimirovi , s. , evans , a. , muller , e.  2006 , , 365 , 1277

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is commonly referred to as @xmath0 and is one of the most important constants , with many applications across a great many fields of science . it is the only mathematical constant that has its own widely - recognized day of celebration . the value of @xmath0 has been controversial at least since the time pythagoras drowned a man for asserting its irrationality . this controversy persists despite theoretical calculation of its value to ridiculously high precision and proofs of its irrationality . given the importance of @xmath0 it is surprising that there is not much of a literature on its measurement since gauss effectively measured it by testing that the sums of the interior angles of a triangle formed by 3 mountain tops added up to 180 degrees . i provide a measurement here . this work is inspired by the indiana house of representatives unanimous vote for a bill that asserted the value of @xmath0 as 3.2 . since this was an astablishment of the value of @xmath0 by legislative means we will refer to it as @xmath2 . most people react with astonishment to this vote , immediately jumping to the conclusion that it is self - evidently false . even at the time the senate did not go along , so it never became law . but what if the basis for the house bill , and indeed its actual meaning , has been misunderstood all this time ? what if they were on to something ? it is especially troubling that the senate did not even allow a vote on the measure . how can we know the truth when this bill never even received the open give and take of parliamentary debate ? was the senate trying to hide something ? fortunately , there are other ways to know . we can _ measure _ it ! an immediate question is what kind of circle we should use . circles around spherical mass distributions have @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ratio of circumference to diameter in euclidean geometry . whereas @xmath5 . such circles will not help us to see how 3.2 can be the correct value . thus we turn to cosmological circles . the larger a circle we consider , the greater the effect of curvature and so we wish to study the largest possible circles . here we conservatively limit ourselves to our own horizon , though consider larger circles in the discussion . i assumed a @xmath6cdm cosmology with the usual six vanilla parameters , plus one parameter for the mean curvature . using a chain available on the lambda archive that included wmap7 @xcite , bao @xcite and @xmath7 measurements @xcite , as described in @xcite , i calculated the comoving angular - diameter distance to the horizon , @xmath8 and also the comoving distance to the horizon , @xmath9 . then i defined @xmath10 histogramming the chain results in the probability distribution displayed in fig . 1 .     given _ wmap_7 , bao and @xmath7 data and the assumption of a 7-parameter @xmath6cdm model.,scaledwidth=50.0% ] note that in a @xmath6-dominated universe with a small amount of mean curvature the value of @xmath0 varies with time . we define a `` legislative universe '' ( lu ) as one for which @xmath11 = 3.2 at some point in time . in future work we will determine the boundary in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane dividing lus from non - lus . we note that lus require a negative spatial curvature ( positive @xmath12 ) . _ perhaps _ coincidentally , from the string theory landscape we also expect our universe to be one with negative spatial curvature , since tunneling events result in such a geometry . or perhaps this `` coincidence '' points toward some deep connection between string theory and the theoretical underpinnings of the legislative value . we tentatively posit that while @xmath14 would be evidence for string theory , @xmath15 would be evidence of this connection . it might instead be evidence of a connection with the de sitter equilibrium cosmology @xcite , for which one also expects a small negative curvature . if one adopts a prior that the legislative value must hold for _ some _ circle in the universe , then we can turn the arguments used here around to place a lower limit on the size of the universe . as long as mean curvature is less than zero ( no matter how close it is to zero ) , if the universe is big enough , the legislative value will hold for a big enough circle . we have explicitly assumed the standard cosmological model extended to include non - zero mean curvature . departures from this model would change our interpretation of the data . in particular , if we consider a model with _ fewer _ species of neutrinos then this increases the sound horizon at last scattering @xcite . in order to keep the angular size of the sound horizon fixed to the observed value , the increased sound horizon means the model would have to adjust in a way to increase the angular - diameter distance to last scattering . one way to do this is to increase @xmath12 @xcite . since the data prefer not fewer species , but an excess of species , allowing @xmath16 to vary would put further pressure on @xmath17 . conversely , adopting a `` legislative prior '' would increase the posterior probability for the standard model value of @xmath16 relative to @xmath18 . we look forward to new data from the south pole telescope and _ planck _ , combined with new bao measurements , from which we can place tighter constraints on @xmath11 , or , by adopting the legislative prior , interesting lower limits to the size of the univerese .
SUMMARY:i present here a measurement of @xmath0 as determined for the largest observable circles . 
 intriguingly , the value of 16/5 asserted by the house of representatives of the state of indiana in 1897 is still viable , although strongly disfavored relative to 22/7 , another popular value . 
 the oft - used ` small - circle ' value of 3 is ruled out at greater than 5@xmath1 . 
 we discuss connections with string theory , sterile neutrinos , and possibilities for ( very large ) lower limits to the size of the universe .

TEXT: magnetic ap stars in short period binary systems are very rare . whereas the incidence of other chemically peculiar a stars in close binary systems is at least as large as in single stars , the incidence of ap stars in close binaries is much lower . this observation may provide insight into the origin of magnetism in a - type stars , and is one of the avenues being pursued by the new binarity and magnetic interactions in various classes of stars ( binamics ) collaboration . as an initial step in this project , we studied three close binary systems which have been suggested to contain ap stars ( hd 22128 , hd 56495 , & hd 98088 ) , in order to asses the presence of magnetic fields and study the atmospheric chemistry of the components . high resolution spectropolarimetric observations of these stars were obtained with the musicos instrument at the observatoire du pic du midi . hd 98088 is a sb2 ( p = 5.905 days , e = 0.184 ; carrier et al . 2002 ) , which was identified as chemically peculiar by @xcite , and magnetic by @xcite . @xcite studied the system s orbital parameters , but there are no modern magnetic or chemical abundance studies . we present new results from @xcite . we applied spectral disentangling to the set of stokes @xmath0 observations of hd 98088 . the disentangled spectra were used for abundance analyses of the two components , by fitting them with synthetic spectra computed with the zeeman code . in the primary , we find strong overabundances of fe - peak elements and rare earths , and roughly solar abundances for lighter elements , indicating an ap star . in the secondary , we find overabundances of fe - peak elements and underabundances of ca and sc , indicating an am star .    in order to assess stellar magnetic fields , we performed least squares deconvolution ( lsd ) on our observations , producing ` mean ' line profiles . in stokes @xmath1 , we find clear zeeman signatures in the primary s lines , and no signal in the secondary s lines . for the primary , longitudinal magnetic fields were measured from the lsd profiles . we measured the rotation period of the primary from the magnetic variability , and the result agrees well with the orbital period , implying that the system is tidally locked . we find the magnetic field of the primary is predominately dipolar , with a polar strength of @xmath2 g.    comparing the magnetic and orbital geometries , we find that one magnetic pole of the primary always points roughly towards the secondary . the dipole axis appears to be @xmath3 out of the orbital plane , and thus the alignment may not be perfect , but it is very suggestive . hd 22128 is a sb2 ( p = 5.086 days , e @xmath40 ; carrier et al . the primary was proposed as an ap star by @xcite and by @xcite . here we present new results from @xcite . an abundance analysis was performed by fitting synthetic sb2 spectra computed with zeeman to the observations . in both stars , we find overabundances of fe - peak elements and rare earths , and underabundances of ca and sc , indicating both components are am stars . we extracted lsd profiles from our observations , and find no detection of a magnetic signature in any stokes v profile . measuring longitudinal magnetic fields from these profiles we find no detection , with uncertainties of @xmath5 g in the primary , and @xmath6 g in the secondary . we conclude that hd 22128 is a close binary containing two very similar am stars , but neither star is a magnetic ap star . hd 56495 is a sb2 ( p = 27.38 days , e = 0.165 ; carrier et al . the primary was proposed as an ap star based on a marginal magnetic detection by @xcite . we present new results from @xcite . we performed an abundance analysis , fitting the sb2 spectrum with zeeman . for the primary , we find clear overabundances of fe - peak elements and underabundances of ca and sc , indicating an am star . for the secondary we find abundances consistent with solar . we computed lsd profiles for our observations , and there is no detection of a magnetic signature in the stokes v profiles . measuring longitudinal magnetic fields from the unblended profiles we detect no magnetic field , with uncertainties of @xmath7 g in the primary , and @xmath8 g in the secondary . we conclude that the primary is an am star and the secondary a normal f star . the results for hd  22128 and hd  56495 suggest that ap stars in close binaries may be even more rare than previously thought .
SUMMARY:short period binary systems containing magnetic ap stars are anomalously rare 
 . this apparent anomaly may provide insight into the origin of the magnetic fields in theses stars . as an early investigation of this 
 , we observed three close binary systems that have been proposed to host ap stars . 
 two of these systems ( hd 22128 and hd 56495 ) we find contain am stars , but not ap stars . 
 however , for one system ( hd 98088 ) we find the primary is indeed an ap star , while the secondary is an am star . 
 additionally , the ap star is tidally locked to the secondary , and the predominately dipolar magnetic field of the ap star is roughly aligned with the secondary . 
 further investigations of hd 98088 are planned by the binamics collaboration .

SUMMARY:giant pulses ( gps ) , occasional individual pulses with an intensity 100 times the average intensity , have been detected in four pulsars todate . 
 their origin is not well understood , but studies suggest a connection between the strength of magnetic field at the light cylinder @xmath0 and the existence of gps . here , we report on detection of significant large amplitude pulses ( laps ) in two more pulsars with high values of @xmath0 , psrs j0218 + 4232 and b1957 + 20 , observed using giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .

TEXT: m81 , at a distance of 4  mpc , is the nearest galaxy with an active galactic nucleus , with the possibly exception of cen a. the nucleus is exceptionally compact : 700  au @xmath0 300  au at 22  ghz , with the size being proportional to @xmath1 ( bietenholz  1996 ; bartel  1995 ; bartel  1982 ; see also kellermann 1976 ) . here we present further results from new vla and vlbi observations of the nucleus of m81 . the nucleus of m81 was used as a reference source for the continuing program of vlbi monitoring of sn1993j ( see rupen   these proceedings p.  [ rupen ] ) . vla data were taken simultaneously with the vlbi runs . flux densities were derived from images , and the results are shown in figure  [ bietef1 ] . the systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration ( 5% ) dominates internal uncertainties . the flux density of m81 varies by over a factor of 2 at 8.4  ghz ( see also van dyk & ho , these proceedings p.  [ vanho ] ) . at this frequency , the mean observed flux density was 120  mjy with a standard deviation of 22  mjy or 19% . the flux densities at 5 and 8.4  ghz seem well correlated , although the radio spectral index ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ) is not constant within our errors : @xmath2 varies by up to @xmath4 . in our vlbi observations , the nucleus of m81 is only slightly resolved and somewhat asymmetrical ( in agreement with bietenholz 1996 ) . in table [ bietet1 ] , we give the results of fitting simple geometrical models to fully calibrated _ u - v _ data . we used the aips program omfit to simultaneously fit model parameters and determine the complex antenna gains . in the simplest case of fitting a single elliptical gaussian , the size varies by 40% . the data , however , are not well described by such a model : in all cases , the fit is significantly improved if we fit , in addition to the central elliptical gaussian source , a weaker point source at relative position @xmath6 . though our resolution is inadequate to determine the detailed source structure , the data clearly demand structure more complicated than a single elliptical gaussian . note that our conservative estimates of the uncertainties take into account any contribution from the fit time - variable antenna gains ( a more complete description will be published elsewhere ) .    in summary , we find that there is structure on scales of @xmath7  mas in the nucleus of m81 . it can be described as an elongated core , with a north - east south - west orientation , and a component of lower flux density to the north - east thereof . this latter component , in particular , appears to be variable on timescales of weeks .
SUMMARY:we report on vla and vlbi observations of the nucleus of the nearby spiral galaxy m81 . 
 the vla observations show the flux density of the nucleus to be variable by 50% . 
 the vlbi observations indicate that the structure of the nucleus of m81 is somewhat variable on timescales of weeks .

TEXT: [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     our survey aims at a limiting magnitude of l@xmath21 for an elliptical galaxy at z@xmath31.5 ( 5@xmath4 ) . table  [ tab : tab2 ] shows the limiting magnitudes and the required exposure times . the multi - colour - classification scheme developed for the cadis and combo-17 surveys ( ( * ? ? ? * wolf , meisenheimer & rser 2001 ) ) will classify all objects and assign photometric redshifts . however , the accuracy of the redshifts will be not as accurate though sufficient for cluster detections . we will employ a 3-dimensional cluster finding algorithm based on finding overdensities in position on the sky and in redshift space . according to its redshift z@xmath5 derived from the multi - colour - classification the projected abell radius r@xmath6 for each object is calculated and the number of objects n@xmath7 within r@xmath6 counted . only objects with velocity differences below a given threshold are added to n@xmath7 : @xmath8    candidate galaxy clusters are found as excess numbers in n@xmath7 which exceed values expected for a random object distribution . from these excess numbers we define an overdensity parameter .    a first test application to the object catalog of the chandra deep - field south ( cdfs ) observed by combo-17 ( field size 31@xmath9@xmath1030@xmath9 ) reveals galaxy overdensities at z@xmath110.5 , 0.7 and 1.1 ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) . in the past several other techniques for identifying clusters of galaxies have been developed . we intend to compare the performance of our algorithm with the voronoi tessellation ( ( * ? ? ? * ramella , boschin , fadda & nonino 2001 ) ) , the matched - filter and the friends - of - friends algorithm . because of the imaging in five filters we will also be able to apply the red sequence approach established for the toronto red - sequence cluster survey ( ( * ? ? ? * gladders & yee 2000 ) ) for various colour combinations . since august 2003 we are collecting the survey data at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope and since december 2002 with the wide - field - imager ( wfi ) at the eso 2.2 m telescope . a first impression of the quality of the ir data gives a pipeline - reduced mosaic of 12 h - band images in the hirocs-22h field observed with the nir wide - field camera omega2000 on this webpage :    http://www.caha.es/newsletter/news04a/omega2000@xmath12mosaic.pdf + it covers almost 3/4@xmath13 ; the psf is @xmath110.@xmath148 . each frame is composed of 25 single exposures with 1 minute exposure time , the limit is 19.9mag ( 5@xmath4 ) . the holes around bright objects are due to over - corrected background , as the pipeline , whose result is shown , uses only a local sky determination .
SUMMARY:clusters of galaxies are the largest bound gravitational systems in the universe . 
 they outline the large scale structure and thus are able to test predictions of cosmological models . 
 detailed studies of galaxy populations in clusters at high z offer insights into galaxy evolution as a function of look - back time . 
 unfortunately , large homogeneous samples of galaxy clusters only exist at redshifts @xmath0 0.5 . 
 there are around 1000 candidate clusters with photometric or otherwise estimated redshifts above 0.5 , but spectroscopically confirmed clusters are still scarce in this redshift regime . some clusters with z@xmath11 have recently been identified from x - ray surveys .

53,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: dispersion measure quantifies the integrated dispersive effect of the plasma between the pulsar and the observing telescope , on the propagating broadband pulsar signal . in general , it varies with time due to reasons such as the transverse motion of pulsar sampling different lines of sight ( los ) through inhomogeneous and turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) , solar wind and solar corona , plasma density changes in the binary orbit and drifting wisps of ionized gas in supernova shell . for pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) , which aim for a final accuracy of 100 @xmath1 or better at l band , dm variations as small as @xmath2 need to be corrected for . meanwhile , the timing accuracies currently achieved for most of the ppta pulsars are still of the order of a @xmath3 and above ( @xcite ) and therefore dm corrections could improve these . as indicated from the observations by @xcite , @xcite , later from analytical derivation , for a turbulent ism , @xmath4 , which implies significant change over a period of a few days to a week for a typical dm of a few tens of @xmath5 . the gmrt , using its low frequency capability , can provide more accurate dm measurements by taking advantage of the inverse - square law dependency of the delay on the observing frequency , as has been demonstrated by @xcite , who had achieved an accuracy of up to @xmath6 for long period pulsars . a program was initiated at the gmrt , in nov 2009 , to carry out roughly bi - weekly simultaneous dual - frequency observations at 325 and 610 mhz for 11 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , primarily to track the dm variations accurately and study their effects on timing accuracy as well as for studying dm variations due to the solar corona and the solar wind . the observations used the gmrt software back - end ( @xcite ) in the simultaneous dual - frequency phased array mode , giving total intensity time - series from 512 channels over 32 mhz of bandwidth at each frequency . in this mode the data streams from the two frequencies are locked to each other without any instrumental delay , allowing accurate dm estimates without requiring absolute timing measurements . the data were incoherently dedispersed and folded using a doppler corrected period . the delay was computed using the peak of the cross - correlation between the profiles at the two frequencies . the dm was computed as @xmath7 , where k , called dispersion constant , is equal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the total delay , as seen at the solar system barycenter , between the signals at the two frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 . errors were estimated by propagating the off - pulse noise of the two profiles to estimate the rms error of the measured delay . significant dm variations are detected ( table [ tab1 ] ) for all the pulsars , with accuracies of @xmath0 achieved for most of them . for most pulsars , the rms dm variation is comparable to that seen in the ppta data and also to the reported value from @xcite . the dm variations seem to show significant correlation with the parkes data for four msps ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . .summary of the dm measurements for nine of the msps . the catalogue period is in @xmath12 , dm@xmath13 and @xmath14 are in @xmath15 . rms@xmath16 and @xmath17 are in @xmath18 . the last four columns give the mean of dm , rms of dm , the mean absolute error of dm over all the epochs and the equivalent toa error at l band ( corresponding to the rms ) in @xmath19s . [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]         the effects of solar corona are clearly detected in the case of low ecliptic latitude pulsars ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , even though many of our data points , up to 25@xmath20 from the sun , seem to disagree with the predictions based on the two - state solar wind model of @xcite , indicating possibilities for further refinements of the model including effects of special events like coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . two - state jumps in psr j1022 + 1001 s dm variation ( figure [ fig3 ] ) are found to be due to small , but quite well defined profile shape changes , akin to the well known mode changing phenomenon seen in some pulsars . further comparisons and studies ( e.g. ism structure function analysis ) will be possible in future as our data extend to longer time spans .
SUMMARY:we present the results from nearly three years of monitoring of the variations in dispersion measure ( dm ) along the line - of - sight to 11 millisecond pulsars using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . 
 these results demonstrate accuracies of single epoch dm estimates of the order of @xmath0 . 
 a preliminary comparison with the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) data shows that the measured dm fluctuations are comparable . 
 we show effects of dm variations due to the solar wind and solar corona and compare with the existing models .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: according to standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) hierarchical clustering theory , there should be numerous low mass dark matter halos present in the universe today . if these halos contain sufficient stars , they should be detectable as dwarf galaxies . observationally this appears to be true for clusters of galaxies where the galactic density is high , but not so for the lower density environments . we conducted a search for these objects in the millennium galaxy strip which runs along the celestial equator in the field , passing through filaments and voids . it is therefore an excellent data set for studies into the influence of the environment on dwarf galaxy populations . we compare these results with those from similar surveys carried out in the virgo and ursa major ( uma ) clusters . our results are unique as the three surveys were conducted using the same instrument , same technique ( exposure time , filter band ) and same selection criteria , thus we can be sure that we are comparing like with like.    low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are difficult to detect as their surface brightnesses are below that of the sky ( @xmath0 ) . the detection algorithm that we developed for this project is optimised for the detection of faint , diffuse objects on ccd frames ( see sabatini et al . 2003 ) . to ensure that the objects picked out by the algorithm are actually dwarf galaxies and not background contamination , a selection criteria based on morphology and magnitude is applied to the objects . this criteria was chosen following simulations of a cone of the universe randomly populated with galaxies , as detailed in roberts et al ( 2003 ) . .summary of results for the three surveys , compared with predictions from cdm [ cols=""^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     we have presented the results obtained for 3 surveys carried out in very different environments ( table 1 ) . we find a dgr in the field of 6:1 , compared to a value of 20:1 in the virgo cluster . this very large ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies found in the virgo cluster indicates that this region is very different to lower density clusters such as uma , and the field where we find relatively few dwarfs . our results for the dgr of the mgs are consistent with those derived from the recent redshift survey determinations of the field lf made by 2df ( norberg et al . 2002 ) even though we sample to some two magnitudes fainter in central surface brightness and magnitude . there is no hidden population of dwarf galaxies that have been missed by the redshift surveys . these observational results are in disagreement with most predictions made by cdm models , commonly referred to as the substructure problem . the models predict far more small dark matter halos than observations detect ( kauffman et al . 1993 ) . a number of theories have been put forward to explain the apparent difference in the observed number of dwarf galaxies in different environments . these range from those which try and explain how more dwarfs may form in rich environments , such as galaxy harassment ( moore et al 1996 ) or the external pressure confining the ejected galaxy gas ( babul & rees 1992 ) , to those ideas which emphasise the suppression of dwarf galaxy formation in the field such as supernovae wind expulsion and galaxy squelching ( tully et al 2002 ) . detailed observations of dwarf galaxies provide a challenge to the concordance cosmological model to which cdm is central . dwarf galaxies are found in large numbers in rich clusters , but not in less dense galactic environments . for the cdm model to remain viable it has to provide a satisfactory solution to this problem . at present , it is not clear which , if any , of the mechanisms described above would be the best to help provide this solution . babul , a. , & rees , m.j . , 1992 , , 255 , 346b kauffmann , g. , white , s.d.m . , guideroni , b. , 1993 , , 264 , 201 moore , b. , lake , g. , quinn , t. , stadel , j . , 1999 , , 304 , 465 m norberg et al . , 2002 , , 336 , 907 roberts , s. , davies , j. , sabatini , s. , baes , m. , linder , s. , smith , r. , evans , rh . , 2003 , submitted sabatini , s. , davies , j. , scaramella , r. , smith , r. , baes , m. , linder , s.m . , roberts , s. , testa , v. , 2003 , , 342 , 981 tully , r.b . , somerville , r.s . , trentham , n. , verheijen , m.a.w . , 2002 , , 569 , 573

[ lm83 ] found for yz cas a that fe is @xmath56 times overabundant , which implies that fe contributes to @xmath543% of z. in order to update the [ lm83 ] study , we applied two corrections to this value : 1 ) they assumed an iron solar abundance a@xmath6@xmath37.60 . more detailed studies give a@xmath6 @xmath3 7.50@xmath40.05 ( [ gs99 ] ) implying that fe contributes to @xmath557% of z. 2 ) their analysis assumed t@xmath7@xmath310,300k . recent determinations give 9100@xmath4300k ( [ r00 ] ) . this would reduce the [ lm83 ] s iron abundance by about 0.15 - 0.20 dex , and then imply that fe contributes to @xmath533% of z. both corrections are opposite and imply altogether that fe contributes to @xmath540% of z. hence , our attempt to update some of the [ lm83 ] assumptions does not change their high - z conclusion . since @xmath8 strmgren colours are available for both components of yz cas ( [ l81 ] , [ j97 ] ) , it is possible to derive [ fe / h ] from existing calibrations . the [ j97 ] photometric indices do not suggest a metallic behaviour of the am star atmosphere : [ fe / h ] is @xmath90.02@xmath40.22 ( [ j00 ] ) , i.e z@xmath30.017@xmath10 ( assuming z@xmath0@xmath30.018 ) . the upper limit is only marginally compatible with the z derived from the iue spectra . assuming the individual photometric indices from [ l81 ] , the derived atmospheric [ fe / h ] is 0.12@xmath40.05 , i.e. z@xmath30.024@xmath40.003 , again only marginally compatible with the iue determination . using strmgren photometry from [ j97 ] and accurate gravities , [ l99 ] derived simultaneous t@xmath7-[fe / h ] estimates from the basel photometric calibrations ( [ l98 ] ) . they obtain [ fe / h ] strictly lower than 0.1 for yz cas a , i.e z@xmath110.022 . this result assumes no reddening which is justified by experiments we performed with the basel models ( see [ l99 ] for details on the method ) for e(b@xmath9y ) ranging from @xmath90.034 ( _ negative _ value of [ l81 ] ) to 0.09 ( maximum value quoted by [ lm83 ] ) . in summary , even if the results of [ j00 ] and [ l99 ] are not completely independent because based on the same colour indices , they suggest that the atmospheric metallicity of yz cas a is solar or sub - solar , and exclude z - values greater than 0.03 .      de landtsheer a.c . , mulder p.s . 1983 , a&a 127 , 297 [ lm83 ] grevesse n. , sauval a.j . 1999 , a&a 347 , 348 [ gs99 ] jordi c. , ribas i. , torra j. , gimnez a. 1997 , a&a 326 , 1044 [ j97 ] jordi c. , 2000 , private communication [ j00 ] lacy c.h . 1981 , apj 251 , 591 [ l81 ] lastennet e. , lejeune th . , westera p. , buser r. 1999 , a&a 341 , 857 [ l99 ] lejeune th . , cuisinier f. , buser r. 1998 , a&as 130 , 65 [ l98 ] ribas i. , jordi c. , torra j. , gimnez a. 2000 , mnras 313 , 99 [ r00 ]
SUMMARY:we review current and new estimates of the eclipsing binary yz cassiopeiae metallicity ( z ) . 
 since the individual components cover a quite large range of mass ( 1.35 - 2.31m@xmath0 ) , yz cas is potentially one of the best stellar laboratories to understand the structure and evolution of 1 to 2 m@xmath0 stars . 
 the derivation of z from iue spectra , as well as from photometric indices , provides the chemical composition of the atmosphere ( z@xmath1 ) , while the fit of evolutionary tracks provides the initial chemical composition ( z@xmath2 ) . while a disagreement is expected between z@xmath1 and z@xmath2 because the primary component is an am star ( one expects z@xmath1 to be larger ) , we find some unexpected discrepancy between atmospheric determinations of z for this star .

TEXT: the study of exo - planets ( eps ) requires many different approaches across the full wavelength spectrum to both discover and characterize the newly discovered objects in order that we might fully understand the prevalence , formation , and evolution of planetary systems . the mid  ir and far  ir spectral regions are especially important in the study of planetary atmospheres as it spans both the peak of thermal emission from the majority of eps thus far discovered ( up to @xmath21000 k ) and is particularly rich in molecular features that can uniquely identify the chemical composition , from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres and trace the fingerprints of primitive biological activity . in the coming decades many space- and ground - based facilities are planned that are designed to search for eps on all scales from massive , young  hot jupiters "" , through large rocky super - earths down to the detection of exo - earths . few of the planned facilities , however , will have the ability to characterize the planetary atmospheres which they discover through the application of mid - ir and far - ir spectroscopy . spica will be realized within @xmath210 years and has a suite of instruments that can be applied to the detection and characterization of eps over the @xmath25210@xmath3 m spectral range ( see e.g.  our _ white paper _ ; goicoechea et al . .    the safari instrument @xcite will provide capabilities to complement spica studies in the mid - ir ( either coronagraphic or transit studies ) . indeed , safari could be the only planned instrument able to study eps in a completely new wavelength domain ( for safari s band 1 ) not covered by _ jwst _ nor by _ herschel _ ( fig .  1 ) . this situation is often associated with unexpected discoveries . since cool eps show much higher contrast in the far - ir than in the near/mid  ir ( e.g.  jupiter s effective temperature is @xmath2110  k ) , if such eps are found in the next 10 years , their transit studies with spica will help to constrain their main properties , which are much more difficult to infer at shorter wavelengths . note that following _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) observations , jupiter seen at 5  pc will produce a flux of @xmath235  @xmath3jy at 37  @xmath3 m , but less than @xmath21  @xmath3jy at 15  @xmath3 m . safari band1 ( @xmath234  60  @xmath3 m ) hosts a variety of interesting atmospheric molecular features ( e.g.  h@xmath0o at 39  @xmath3 m , hd at 37  @xmath3 m and nh@xmath1 at 40 and 42  @xmath3 m ) . strong emission / absorption of these features was first detected by iso in the atmospheres of jupiter , saturn , titan , uranus and neptune @xcite .
SUMMARY:the far - infrared ( far - ir ) spectral window plays host to a wide range of spectroscopic diagnostics with which to study planetary disk systems and exoplanets at wavelengths completely blocked by the earth atmosphere . 
 these include the thermal emission of dusty belts in debris disks , the water ice features in the  snow lines "" of protoplanetary disks , as well as many key chemical species ( o , oh , h@xmath0o , nh@xmath1 , hd , etc ) . 
 these tracers play a critical diagnostic role in a number of key areas including the early stages of planet formation and potentially , exoplanets . 
 the proposed japanese - led ir space telescope spica , with its 3m  class cooled mirror ( @xmath25k ) will be the next step in sensitivity after _ 
 esa s herschel space observatory _ 
 ( successfully launched in  may 2009 ) .

TEXT: the european neutrino telescope experiments @xcite have joined their efforts in the km3net project @xcite to design a @xmath0-scale deep - sea neutrino telescope in the mediterranean . a neutrino telescope of these dimensions on the northern hemisphere , complementary to icecube @xcite , is necessary for high - energy neutrino astronomy .    as a first step for the km3net project , a detailed simulation study of different detector models and photo - detectors is necessary . the software used by the antares collaboration , with some modifications , is flexible enough for this task and was used for this study . the modifications include the adaptation to a larger detector and a new causality filter for the event reconstruction @xcite . in addition some changes were necessary to implement the different photo - detection systems presented in this work . nonetheless the reconstruction and the selection cuts are optimized for antares , and are therefore not necessarily optimal for different detector designs . however as the results show similar efficiencies for the detector models studied in this work and for the antares detector , any reconstruction induced inefficiencies must be small . the event sample used contained @xmath1 muon neutrinos with energies distributed between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and incident isotropically from the whole solid angle . only charged - current @xmath4n interactions were simulated , and the hadronic component of the final state was neglected . a background rate of 91 hz per @xmath5 of photocathode area was used , corresponding to @xmath6 for a 10 "" photomultiplier . for comparison of different detector models the neutrino effective area was calculated as a function of the neutrino energy . the angular resolution , defined as the median angular deviation between reconstructed and true neutrino direction , was derived from the results , again as a function of energy . the different photomultiplier ( pm ) configurations ( storeys ) considered in this work are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] . @xmath7 antares storey with 3 10 "" pms .    @xmath7 single cylinder with 35 3 "" pms , where each pm is read out individually . @xmath7 three smaller cylinders with 12 3 "" pms each , hits occuring in one of the sub - cylinders , within a predefined time window are added . the overall photocathode area of these structures is comparable . small pms generally have a higher quantum efficiency and a better transit time spread ( tts ) . +    a disadvantage of the single cylinder structure lies in its vulnerability to mechanical stability problems . additionally individual readout of 35 pms within a very confined space might not be feasible . therefore the triple cylinder variant was proposed . by adding hits in one sub - cylinder the amount of necessary readout electronics is reduced considerably .     +    for comparison these photodetector units where placed in a cubic kilometer grid with a string and storey distance of @xmath8 ( 4913 storeys ) . effective areas calculated for these detectors are shown in fig.[fig2 ] . obviously the single cylinder storey is superior at energies below @xmath9 . the reconstruction requires a certain minimal number of pm hits , a fact that is especially important at low energies , where the number of signal hits is very low . in the single cylinders the high number of individual hits explains the good low - energy efficiency .    at energies between one and a few hundred tev , the single and triple cylinder storeys are comparable and both superior to the antares storey . for the single cylinder this can again be explained by a larger number of hits . the reason in case of the triple cylinder is the requirement of local coincidences in one storey and/or hits with high amplitudes . coincident hits in one of the triple cylinders are added and therefore transformed into a high amplitude hit . the angular resolution is very similar for all three cases , with a common overall median of @xmath10 . the efficiency of a detector at low energies is correlated to the distance between the pms . a possible way to combine low- and high - energy performance is to use clusters of densely instrumented strings as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . low - energy muons have a high detection probability inside the clusters , while high - energy muons have a chance to hit several of the clusters , thus seeing a large instrumented volume .     +    as expected , effective area ( fig.[fig4 ] ) , and angular resolution ( fig.[fig5 ] ) are significantly better than for the cube at energies below @xmath11 . at higher energies the performance is about 20% worse . +     +    above approximately @xmath9 the muon range in water exceeds the dimensions of the instrumented volume of a @xmath0-scale detector . starting from this energy , most of the muons will enter the detector from the outside . therefore the cross section area of the detector starts to become more important than a densely instrumented volume .    in order to exploit this effect the design of a ring - shaped detector with a densely instrumented boundary was studied . examples of string layouts for such detectors are shown in fig.[fig6 ] . +    effective areas for the rings , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , are slightly higher at low energies , due to the denser storey spacing in the ring . the angular resolution is very similar to the homogeneous case . several promising concepts of pm configurations and geometries for the design of the mediterranean @xmath0 neutrino detector were considered .    through simulations it was shown that the use of many small pms in pressure cylinders can provide better performance as conventional large hemispherical pms . inhomogeneous geometries have been shown to increase efficiency at low energies with only small losses at high energies , while drastically reducing the number of necessary strings . the decision for a definite configuration has to depend on the physics priorities of the project , as the performance of the different detector concepts depends on the neutrino energy . further studies with dedicated software for a @xmath0-scale detector are absolutely necessary to further clarify the results presented here , since the software used for this work is optimized for the antares detector .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the cdf diffractive physics program relies on two miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters , which can detect both charged and neutral particles , to measure the event energy flow in the very forward rapidity region on opposite sides of the interaction point . the performance of a mp prototype is published in @xcite , while the final detector assembly and the results from a cosmic ray test are reported in @xcite . the mps consist of alternating layers of lead plates and liquid scintillator read out by _ wavelength shifting _ ( wls ) fibers ( fig .  [ fig : routing ] ) . the fibers are perpendicular to the lead plates and parallel to the proton / antiproton beams , and are read out by _ multi - channel photomultiplier tubes _ ( mcpmts ) . the 16-channel hamamatsu r5900 mcpmts have a quartz window which improves the radiation hardness . each mp is housed in a cylindrical steel vessel 26@xmath2 in diameter and has a 5@xmath2 hole concentric with the vessel to accommodate the beam pipe . the depth of a mp is 32 radiation lengths and 1.3 interaction lengths . the short hadronic depth limits the lateral spread of the showers . the mps have a novel _ towerless _ geometry with no dead regions , due to the lack of internal boundaries , and towers are formed by combining the desired number of fibers . the centroid of the tower pulse height provides the position of the shower initiating particle . the tower design is based on an hexagon geometry . holes in the lead plate are conceptually grouped in hexagons , each with six holes . the six fibers inserted in the holes of a hexagon are grouped together and are viewed by one mcpmt channel . [ fig : routing ]    a seventh fiber , which is clear and carries the light from a calibration led , is also read out by each mcpmt pixel to allow a periodical monitoring of the mcpmt response . the mcpmt outputs are added to form 84 calorimeter towers per mp , organized in four concentric rings around the beam pipe . the entire mcpmt can also be read out through the last dynode output to provide trigger information . each mp has a total of 18 trigger towers , arranged in three rings . cosmic ray muons were used to test one 60@xmath3 wedge of the east mp . the cosmic ray trigger fired on a 2-fold coincidence of scintillation counter paddles located on top and at the bottom of the mp vessel , placed with towers pointing upward . the single photoelectron response was measured using a randomly gated signal from a @xmath4 source . the response to a minimum ionizing particle was found to be above 100 photoelectrons , exceeding the design specifications . although a precise energy calibration is not crucial to the analysis of diffractive processes , an attempt was made to estimate the energy of jets and particles using colliding beam data from run ii . for each tower , the adc count distribution of a sample of minimum bias events can be fitted well by a falling exponential curve ( fig . [ fig : slopes ] , top ) . a monte carlo simulation was then used to calibrate the pseudorapidity dependence of the tower - by - tower response . due to pile - up effects at larger rapidity regions , a luminosity dependence of the adc count distribution slope is observed ( fig . [ fig : slopes ] , bottom ) . a linear fit describes well the data , with the slope decreasing with increasing values of instantaneous luminosity . the particle multiplicity is measured by counting clusters of towers with energy above noise ( fig . [ fig : lego ] ) .
SUMMARY:two miniplug calorimeters , designed to measure the energy and lateral position of particles in the pseudorapidity region of @xmath0 of the cdf detector , have been installed as part of the run ii cdf upgrade at the tevatron collider . 
 detector performance and first results from @xmath1 collision data are presented .

TEXT: in constructing models beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as technicolor or supersymmetric theories , it is important to test their viability by looking for possible conflicts with currently available experimental data . a popular procedure has been the @xmath0 oblique correction analysis of ref . however , the method can only be applied to theories which satisfy three conditions , namely ( 1 ) the electroweak gauge group is the standard @xmath2 , ( 2 ) vertex and box corrections from new physics are negligible , and ( 3 ) the scale of new physics is large compared to the electroweak scale . furthermore , the oblique correction analysis requires ( 4 ) the model to be completely specified since any particle with electroweak gauge quantum numbers will show up in a vacuum polarization loop . many theories of interest do not fall into this category . for instance , in the topcolor assisted technicolor model of ref . @xcite , ( 1 ) the electroweak gauge group is @xmath3 resulting in an extra @xmath4 boson , ( 2 ) there are potentially large corrections to the @xmath5 vertex for third generation fermions coming from @xmath4 and coloron exchange , ( 3 ) the scale of new physics may be as low as a tev , and ( 4 ) the technisector of the theory remains unspecified . the solution to our predicament lies in the observation that a large number of electroweak observables have been measured accurately at lep and sld _ on the @xmath1pole _ , and that the majority of them are just _ ratios of coupling constants _ of the @xmath1 to quarks and leptons . this means that they are only sensitive to oblique corrections through the effective value of @xmath6 _ at that particular energy scale_. therefore , one can use just one of the observables , @xmath7 say , to _ fix _ the value of @xmath6 , and use it to predict all the rest for the sm . any deviations of the data from those predictions must be due to _ vertex corrections _ from new physics . this method of comparing sm predictions to @xmath1pole electroweak observables solves all of the problems mentioned above since ( 1 ) mixing of the @xmath1 with extra gauge bosons can be treated as a vertex correction , ( 2 ) vertex corrections need not be small while box corrections are still naturally suppressed on the @xmath1pole , ( 3 ) the new physics scale need not be large since only observables at one scale are used in the analysis , and ( 4 ) the theory need not be specified completely since the method is blind to oblique corrections . this method has been used successfully to constrain the size of possible vertex corrections to the @xmath8 vertex @xcite , and to constrain the topcolor assisted technicolor model mentioned above @xcite . we have also applied the technique to constrain : an r  parity violating extension to the mssm @xcite , higgs masses in a general two higgs doublet model @xcite , and the fundamental planck scale of a model with large extra dimensions @xcite . details are provided in the respective references . this work was supported in part by the u.s . department of energy , grant de fg0592er40709 , task  a.

TEXT: the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) is recognised as one of the most massive concentrations of galaxies in the local universe@xcite so it is of particular interest to consider its effect on the dynamics of the local group@xcite . previous studies@xcite,@xcite concentrated on the rich abell galaxy clusters in the region , but this might give a very biased view of the supercluster . in this paper we present new data obtained with the flair - ii multi - fibre spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope at the anglo - australian observatory . this has 90 fibres in a @xmath1 deg@xmath0 field allowing us to measure a more uniform distribution of ssc galaxies , avoiding any bias in favour of the rich clusters . we selected galaxies from digitised red eso / src sky survey plates to a limit of @xmath2 . after removing galaxies with known redshifts and randomly selecting between any too close to another galaxy or star to observe we obtained samples of about 100 galaxies per schmidt field . we observed 3 fields centred on the ssc , obtaining velocities for a total of 189 galaxies in the sample ; full details are published elsewhere@xcite . the results presented in fig .  1 show that both components of the ssc extend much further to the south than was previously thought . these form sheets of galaxies which extend to the full area we measured , and presumably beyond as well . our measurements to the north of the cluster were much less complete ( only one field in poor weather ) so we can not exclude the possibility that these sheets of galaxies extend equally to the north . it was earlier concluded@xcite from the velocity distribution of the clusters that the ssc was very elongated and either inclined towards us or rotating : we can now see that this is not the case . [ 0cm][0 cm ]    we measured 152 new ssc galaxies in the velocity range @xmath3 compared to 864 previously known . if the ssc is equally extended to the north as to the south we might expect to find a further additional 150 galaxies or a total of an extra 30% of galaxies in the central region of the ssc . the effect of the mass of the ssc on the dynamics of the local group was previously estimated@xcite to account for at least 25% of the motion of the local group with respect to the cosmic microwave background . our new data suggest that the ssc is at least 30% more massive with a significant part of the extra mass in the closer sub - region . the ssc therefore has an even more important effect on the local group than previously thought .
SUMMARY:we present new radial velocities for 189 galaxies in a 91 deg@xmath0 region of the shapley supercluster measured with the flair - ii spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope . 
 the data reveal two sheets of galaxies linking the major concentrations of the supercluster . 
 the supercluster is not flattened in declination as was suggested previously and it may be at least 30% larger than previously thought with a correspondingly larger contribution to the motion of the local group .

TEXT: it is commonly known that , according to the first law of dynamics , in the absence of an external force , every object remains in rest or moves along a straight line with uniform velocity . the aforementioned law is valid under the assumption that the mass of the object in question is constant . in many textbooks ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and dedicated papers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) the problem of variable mass bodies or systems was thoroughly analyzed . however , in all the examples it is assumed that an influx or efflux of mass is a uniformly changing function of time . in order to fill the gap we focus here on the dynamics of an oscillating mass object . it turns out that the study of behavior of such a body brings forward interesting physical results and consequences . let us consider an object with an initial mass of @xmath0 and its mass is some function of time @xmath1 . additionally , we assume that there is no external force acting on the body ( @xmath2 ) . the equation of motion in this case can be written down in the form @xmath3 from which it clearly follows that @xmath4 . now , since mass varies with time , we find that @xmath5 substituting eq . ( [ mfv ] ) into ( [ p ] ) we get that @xmath6 the product in the second term of lhs of eq . ( [ fgen0 ] ) may be equal to zero only if the first term vanishes . under the initial assumption that the mass changes in time , it happens only if @xmath7 . rearranging the terms in eq . ( [ fgen0 ] ) we immediately arrive at the equation @xmath8 or if we utilize eq . ( [ mfv ] ) we get @xmath9 as we can see , in case @xmath10 we observe no acceleration and therefore we obtain the classical equation of motion of a body upon which no external force is acting ( @xmath11 ) . however , in all other cases the acceleration turns up that is proportional to the mass change ratio . it also should be stressed here that , in general , the acceleration @xmath12 is not constant in time . in this section we deal with a massive object whose mass oscillates in time . the choice of such a mass function is due to a sound assumption that energy should be conserved in time , i.e. an influx and efflux of energy are then compensated . it also means that the mass of the body remains constant if averaged over an integer number of oscillations .    here we assume the mass function to be of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an amplitude of oscillations and @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 substituting eqs . ( [ mf ] ) and ( [ mfder ] ) into ( [ af ] ) we get that @xmath17     given by eq . ( [ acc ] ) ( solid ) vs.  @xmath18 function ( dashed ) . @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 were assumed here.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as we can see in fig . [ fig1 ] , the acceleration function given by eq . ( [ acc ] ) is significantly similar to a cosine function , and therefore resembles the oscillatory motion in which acceleration of a body is described by such a function . by integrating eq . ( [ mfv ] ) in which the mass function @xmath23 is given by eq . ( [ mf ] ) we get the solution of the equation of motion in the form @xcite @xmath24 the function described by eq . ( [ xft ] ) is plotted in fig . [ fig2 ] for the same initial conditions and values as in fig . it is clearly noticeable that this type of motion is periodic , however it bears no resemblance to the regular oscillatory motion . it can also be easily checked that for @xmath25 eq . ( [ xft ] ) turns into well - known formula @xmath26 . as we have shown , in the absence of an external force applied to a body it is possible that the body will accelerate provided its mass changes with time . except for the rest reference frame , an observer notices non - zero acceleration of the body . the example directly indicates that the acceleration of an oscillating mass body is similar to the case of a classical oscillator , however the solution of the equation of motion reveals a significant difference from the oscillatory motion . these results may be important for many - body systems in which mass is exchanged between particles or bodies . in view of the aforementioned facts it may also be a contribution to a comprehension of quantum null oscillations on a classical ground by applying the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath27 which states that the energy ( and mass ) of the system is not _ strictly _ conserved and therefore serve as an attempt to establish a common ground for classical and quantum mechanics .
SUMMARY:we examine the problem of motion of an oscillating mass object provided no external force is applied to it . 
 calculations directly lead to the conclusion that the body accelerates in each system of reference except for the rest reference frame . 
 although its motion is periodic , it bears no resemblance to harmonic oscillations .

income neighborhoods experiencing lower water pressure and shorter supply durations than high - income ones  @xcite . intermittent supply not only limits water availability , but also compromises water quality and damages infrastructure . with field data from urban india , kumpel and nelson @xcite quantified the deleterious effect of intermittency on water quality , showing that both the initial flushing of water through empty pipes  as well as periods of low pressure  corresponded with periods of increased turbidity and bacterial contamination . christodoulou  @xcite observed when that a drought in cypress ushered in two years of intermittent supply , pipe ruptures increased by 30%70% per year . whereas intermittent water supply creates challenges for water managers and water users , the phenomenon creates opportunities for applied mathematics . it is an interesting and difficult mathematical problem to efficiently model transient pipe flow in networks  including transitions to and from pressurized states  with uncertain or complex boundary conditions . in this work we introduce a framework to not only describe intermittent water supply , but also use optimization to improve either our description of the system , or the operation of the described system in order to reduce risks such as infrastructure damage . intermittent supply falls in somewhat of a modeling gap . water distribution software abounds , including the free and open source software epanet  @xcite produced by the us government , as well as many commercial packages  @xcite . yet , to the authors knowledge , all these fail to account for filling , emptying , and instances of subatmospheric pressure  phenomena that are vitally important for users and managers dealing with intermittent supply . sewer system software such as the storm water management model ( swmm )  @xcite and illinois transient model ( itm )  @xcite to some extent handle the physics of interest , but are packaged in elaborate graphical user interfaces and are not readily amenable to model improvements or optimization . furthermore , the authors have encountered a relative paucity of research work dealing with modeling intermittent supply . the work of de marchis  @xcite explicitly studies filling and emptying in a water distribution system in palermo , italy , but with a method of characteristics implementation of the classical water hammer equations . this treatment assumes pipes are either entirely dry or entirely full , and that air pressure inside the pipes is always atmospheric . after calibrating a friction parameter , they found about 5% agreement with empirical data . subsequent work reported by de marchis  @xcite uses the same model to assess losses in the distribution system . freni  @xcite , uses this model to determine pressure valve settings to reduce distribution inequality , but through scenario comparison rather than optimization . for sewer flow , sanders  @xcite presents a network implementation of the two - component pressure approach ( tpa ) of vasconcelos  @xcite . the modeling for itm was published by len in  @xcite . urban water drainage is coupled to free surface flow by borsche and klaar  @xcite . note that buosso et al . @xcite give a general review of the storm water drainage literature with more details than we have provided here . the present work comprises an effort to address the scarcity of tools available for those interested in modeling the details of intermittent supply , and to specifically incorporate such tools within an optimization framework . we use an underlying model of coupled systems of one - dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws that strikes a balance between real - world relevance and both computational and theoretical tractability . our computational framework will allow for straightforward implementation of alternative physical models in future studies . the preissman slot formulation  @xcite is used to describe flow within each pipe , building on existing literature for transient , transition flow in closed conduits . the flow is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible . the dynamical description considers depth - averaged flow within a modified geometry that permits a single set of equations to describe both free - surface and pressurized flow . consideration of one - dimensional dynamics is a reasonable approximation given that the ratio of pipe diameter @xmath0 to pipe length @xmath1 is 1% or smaller in realistic scenarios .
SUMMARY:in many urban areas of the developing world , piped water is supplied only intermittently , as valves direct water to different parts of the water distribution system at different times . 
 the flow is transient , and may transition between free - surface and pressurized , resulting in complex dynamical features with important consequences for water suppliers and users . here 
 , we develop a computational model of transition , transient pipe flow in a network , accounting for a wide variety of realistic boundary conditions . 
 we validate the model against several published data sets , and demonstrate its use on a real pipe network . 
 the model is extended to consider several optimization problems motivated by realistic scenarios . 
 we demonstrate how to infer water flow in a small pipe network from a single pressure sensor , and show how to control water inflow to minimize damaging pressure transients .

TEXT: spectral lag is a common feature in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . the lag is defined as the difference in time of arrival of high and low energy photons and is considered positive when the high - energy photons arrive earlier than the low energy ones . norris et al . reported a correlation between spectral lag and the isotropic peak luminosity of grbs based on a limited sample  @xcite . subsequently , various authors have studied the lag - luminosity relation using arbitrary observer - frame energy bands of various instruments  @xcite . typically the spectral lag ( @xmath3 ) is extracted in two arbitrary energy bands in the observer - frame . however , because of the redshift ( z ) dependance of grbs , the two energy bands can correspond to multiple energy bands in the source - frame thus introducing a variable energy dependant factor , which is difficult to take into account . we avoid this difficulty by defining two energy bands ( @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev ) in the grb source - frame and projecting these two bands into the observer - frame using the relation @xmath4 . for our sample of grbs , after projecting to the observer - frame , the selected energy bands lie in the @xmath2 burst alert telescope ( bat )  @xcite energy range ( @xmath5 kev ; see fig . [ fig01 ] ) . then we extracted the spectral lags between these energy channels , correct them for cosmological time dilations using the relation , @xmath6 and plot them as a function of the isotropic peak luminosity . @xmath2 bat is a highly sensitive coded aperture instrument  @xcite . bat uses the modulation pattern resulting from the coded mask to facilitate background subtraction in the light curve and the spectral processing . this process is called mask weighting . we used the mask weighted , background - subtracted light curves , as well as non - mask weighted light curves in our analysis . the non - mask weighted light curves have about 30% better signal - to - noise ratio than the mask weighted light curves . hence , when the signal - to - noise ratio of mask weighted light curves was too small , non - mask weighted light curves were used to extract spectral lags . kev and @xmath1 kev are plotted against the isotropic peak luminosity . red data points indicate spectral lag values obtained from mask weighted light curves and blue indicate lag values extracted from non - mask weighted light curves.,width=453 ]    the spectral lags were extracted using improved cross - correlation function ( ccf ) analysis method described in reference  @xcite . in this method the spectral lag is extracted by finding the time delay corresponding to the global maximum of the ccf . a gaussian curve was fitted to the ccf to extract the spectral lag . the uncertainty in the spectral lag is obtained by simulating 1,000 light curves and repeating the aforementioned procedure . the standard deviation of the simulated spectral lag values is taken as the lag uncertainty . the isotropic peak luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , for each grb , is obtained by calculating the peak flux for the source - frame energy range , 1.0 kev to 10,000 kev , using the observed spectral - fit parameters and the luminosity distance as described in  @xcite . we used the sample of 31 grbs in reference  @xcite . however , some of the grbs in the sample did not have enough signal - to - noise to extract a spectral lag limiting the final sample to 22 grbs .    in our analysis , we have selected the grb source - frame energy bands @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev due to the energy range of @xmath2 bat and the redshift range of our sample . for mask weighted light curves , the effective energy range of the bat reduces to 15 - 200 kev , which implies a grb redshift range of 1 to 5.7 . however , for the non - mask weighted light curves we do nt have such a restriction and the full bat energy range ( @xmath5 kev ) can be utilized . in this case the redshift lower limit can be as low as 0.2 . our final sample of 22 grbs have redshift ranging from 0.54 to 5.46 .    in fig . [ fig02 ] , @xmath7 is plotted as a function of redshift corrected spectral lag . the spectral lag is anti - correlated with @xmath7 with a correlation coefficient of -0.76 @xmath8 0.06 . the index of the best - fit power - law is @xmath9 , which is shallower compared to observer - frame results from norris et al . 2000 @xcite ( @xmath10 ) and ukwatta et al . 2009 @xcite ( @xmath11 ) . we have investigated the spectral lag between @xmath12 kev and @xmath13 kev energy bands at the grb source - frame by projecting these bands to the observer - frame . this is a step forward in the investigation of lag - luminosity relation since all previous investigations used arbitrary observer - frame energy bands . the correlation coefficient of @xmath14 shows a significant improvement over the average correlation coefficient of @xmath15 reported in the reference @xcite .
SUMMARY:we have investigated the empirical lag - luminosity relation in the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) source - frame . 
 we selected two energy bands ( @xmath0 kev and @xmath1 kev ) in the grb source - frame , which after redshift correction , lie in the observer - frame energy range of the @xmath2 burst alert telescope ( bat ) . 
 the spectral lags between these energy channels are then presented as a function of the isotropic peak luminosity of the grbs in the sample .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ( also know as helium stars ) are the likely progenitors of grbs . the more massive wr stars produce black holes at core - collapse and their radius is small enough for the relativistic jets to reach the stellar surface and produce the prompt grb emission . wr stars have dense high - velocity winds that produce large stellar - wind bubbles through which the afterglow jet will propagate after the grb event . observations of afterglows agree with models of the stellar wind bubbles ( e.g. eldridge et al.(2006 ) and reference therein ) . a problem remains that the free - wind region of the bubbles , where the density scales as @xmath0 , is always large and should be observed in every grb afterglow . however for many grb afterglows a constant density medium ( cdm ) has been inferred from afterglow observations . there is some uncertainty in estimating the circumburst environment but cdms tend to be preferred . van marle et al . ( 2006 ) have investigated how to move a cdm into closer proximity with the progenitor and found a number of possible effects such as stellar motion through the ism . however there is another possibility , the grb progenitors must be rapidly rotating at the time of core collapse to ensure that the material around the forming black hole has enough angular momentum to produce an accretion disk . stellar rotation can produce a strong effect on the stellar - wind bubble that has not been considered . ignace et al . ( 1996 ) investigated the effect of rotation on stellar winds for various stellar types . they found that even moderate rotation of a wr star will effect the density of the wind at different latitudes on the stellar surface . this will effect the position of the wind termination shock by varying the ram pressure ( @xmath1 ) with latitude . their work is supported by observations of wolf - rayet binary cx cephei . the light from the star is strongly polarised ( approximately 4 percent ) which was used to infer that the wr star is rapidly rotating producing a equator - to - pole wind density ratio of 5 ( villar - sbaffi et al . using the results of ignace et al . ( 1996 ) we produced models of the distorted wind bubbles modifying the code used by eldridge et al . density profiles through two simulations are shown in figure 1 . we see that if rotation reduces the polar wind density the distance to the cdm is reduced . therefore in the rotating case the afterglow jet is more likely to inferred to be propagating through a cdm . how close the cdm can move to the progenitor depends on how quickly the wind is accelerated and the rate of rotation . for a standard wr star wind the predictions in figure 1 are the result of a rotation rate of 45 percent of the stellar break - up velocity . we are currently working to determine how this effect changes for different wr stars . such calculations are complicated as wr winds are optically thick so common assumptions of line driven winds can not be applied . it is important to note that if the star is rotating close to break - up velocity then it may become highly distorted and the mass - loss geometry may become very different from that shown here ( owocki , cranmer & gayley 1996 ) .
SUMMARY:gamma - ray bursts ; massive stars ; stellar - wind bubbles . 
 if wolf - rayet stars are the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , they must rotate rapidly to produce the grb . 
 this rotation may effect their stellar - wind bubbles and possibly explain why so many grb afterglows occur in a constant density medium .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: photon orbital angular momentum ( poam ) [ @xcite ] has attracted attention for astronomical applications [ @xcite ] and applications at the quantum level for quantum communication [ @xcite ] . the generation of beams carrying poam , described by laguerre - gaussian ( l - g ) modes , proceeds thanks to the insertion in the optical path of a phase modifying device ( fork hologram ) imprinting a certain vorticity on the phase distribution of the incident beam [ @xcite ] . the vorticity is characterized by parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 describing the orbital and azimuthal angular momentum . here we describe a prototype of a finger mask for binary systems using a @xmath2 fork - hologram . the coronagraphic mask setup was tested using as source two 632 nm he - ne lasers collimated into our @xmath2 fork  hologram simulating a binary system having for each star angular diameter of 20marcsec , namely the one produced by a 8.2 m vlt - like telescope with adaptive optics . the primary star lies on the center of the optical system , on axis and crossing the fork - hologram singularity , while the light beam representing the secondary star is off - axis . tilted and displaced beams do not possess a single l - g mode , but show a spectrum of modes that depend on their geometrical properties [ @xcite ] , which makes possible the detection of a fainter companion . the light of the main star is spread over the donought - shaped disk , while the fainter companion appears as a modification of the l - g mode structures of the primary star . by setting the stars at a very small distance for which the star is unresolved , we note that the l - g profile of both the contributions has its characteristic donought - symmetric shape . when the fainter star is resolved following the rayleigh limit , we see that the first outer ring surrounding the donought becomes brighter and the level of the background in the ring region rises up the more the separated are the sources , thus revealing the presence of a fainter companion . a fork - shaped hologram is equivalent to a set of cylindric lenses as currently used in modern coronagraphs for extrasolar planets and have the same optical properties of modifying the phase of the light . further tests are currently being performed to improve the contrast of our finger - mask . photon distribution of light having non null orbital angular momentum presents certain features that could give some advantages to astronomical applications , such as giving better evidence to closeby or fainter sources in a double system . the authors would like to acknowledge the support of eso - feasibility study of owl instruments and zeilinger group , university of vienna , for the helpful discussions and support for this work .
SUMMARY:we propose to realize an optical device based on the properties of photon orbital angular momentum ( poam ) to detect the presence of closeby faint companions in double systems using laguerre - gaussian ( l - g ) modes of the light . 
 we test also the possibility of using l - g modes to build coronagraph mask . 
 we realized in the laboratory a prototype using a blazed l=1 hologram to simulate the separation between two stars , as observed with a telescope , in laguerre - gaussian modes .

TEXT: the open connectome project ( located at http://openconnecto.me ) aims to annotate all the features in a 3d volume of neural em data , connect these features , and compute a high resolution wiring diagram of the brain , known as a connectome . it is hoped that such work will help elucidate the structure and function of the human brain . the aim of this work is to automatically annotate axoplasmic reticula , since it is extremely time consuming to hand - annotate them . specifically , the objective is to achieve an operating point with high precision , to enable robust contextual inference . there has been very little previous work towards this end @xcite . axoplasmic reticula are present only in axons , indicating the identity of the surrounding process and informing automatic segmentation . the brain data we are working with was color corrected using gradient - domain image - stitching techniques @xcite to adjust contrast through the slices . we use this data as the testbed for running our filters and annotating axoplasmic reticula . the bilateral filter @xcite is a non - linear filter consisting of one 2d gaussian kernel @xmath0 , which decays with spatial distance , and one 1d gaussian kernel @xmath1 , which decays with pixel intensity : @xmath2_p =   \frac{1}{w_p}\sum_{q\in s}g_{\sigma_{s}}(||p - q||)g_{\sigma_{r}}(i_p - i_q)i_q,\\      & \hspace{4mm}\textrm{where } w_p = \sum_{q\in s}g_{\sigma_{s}}(||p - q||)g_{\sigma_{r}}(i_p - i_q ) \end{split}\ ] ] is the normalization factor . this filter smooths the data by averaging over neighboring pixels while preserving edges , and consequently important detail , by not averaging over pixels with large intensity difference . applying this filter accentuates features like axoplasmic reticula in our data . even with a narrow gaussian in the intensity domain , the bilateral filter causes some color bleeding across edges . we try to undo this effect through laplacian sharpening . the laplacian filter computes the difference between the intensity at a pixel and the average intensity of its neighbors . therefore , adding a laplacian filtered image to the original image results in an increase in intensity where the average intensity of the surrounding pixels is less than that of the center pixel , an intensity drop where the average is greater , and no change in areas of constant intensity . hence , we use the 3x3 laplacian filter to highlight edges around dark features such as axoplasmic reticula . we use a morphological region growing algorithm on our filtered data to locate and annotate axoplasmic    26.5 mm     @xmath3    26.5 mm     @xmath3    26.5 mm     @xmath3    26.5 mm     @xmath3    26.5 mm     26.5 mm     2 reticula . we implement this by iterating over the filtered image and looking for dark pixels , where a dark pixel is defined as a pixel with value less than a certain specified threshold . when a dark pixel is found , we check its 8-neighborhood to determine if the surrounding pixels are also below the threshold . then , we check the pixels surrounding these , and we do this until we find only high intensity pixels , or until we grow larger than the diameter of an axoplasmic reticula . the thresholds we use in our algorithm are biologically motivated and tuned empirically . finally , we track our annotations through the volume to verify their correctness and identify axoplasmic reticula that were missed initially . for each slice , we traverse the annotations and check if an axoplasmic reticulum is present in the corresponding xy - location ( with some tolerance ) in either of the adjacent slices . if a previously annotated axoplasmic reticulum object is present , we confirm the existing annotation . otherwise , the adjacent slice locations are checked for axoplasmic reticula with a less restrictive growing algorithm , and new annotations are added in the corresponding slice . if no axoplasmic reticulum object is found in either of the adjacent slices , then we assume the annotation in the current slice to be incorrect , and delete it . we qualitatively evaluated our algorithm on 20 slices from the kasthuri11 dataset , and quantitatively compared our results against ground truth from a neurobiologist . our algorithm annotates axoplasmic reticulum objects with 87% precision , and 52% recall . these numbers are approximate since there is inherent ambiguity even among expert annotators . our current algorithm is designed to detect transverally sliced axoplasmic reticula . in future work , we plan to extend our morphological region growing algorithm to also find dilated axoplasmic reticula , and to incorporate a more robust tracking method such as kalman or particle filtering . additionally , our algorithm can be adapted to annotate other features in neural em data , such as mitochondria , by modifying the morphological region growing algorithm .
SUMMARY:* _ abstract _ : * in this paper , we present a new pipeline which automatically identifies and annotates axoplasmic reticula , which are small subcellular structures present only in axons . 
 we run our algorithm on the kasthuri11 dataset , which was color corrected using gradient - domain techniques to adjust contrast . 
 we use a bilateral filter to smooth out the noise in this data while preserving edges , which highlights axoplasmic reticula . 
 these axoplasmic reticula are then annotated using a morphological region growing algorithm . additionally , we perform laplacian sharpening on the bilaterally filtered data to enhance edges , and repeat the morphological region growing algorithm to annotate more axoplasmic reticula . 
 we track our annotations through the slices to improve precision , and to create long objects to aid in segment merging . 
 this method annotates axoplasmic reticula with high precision . 
 our algorithm can easily be adapted to annotate axoplasmic reticula in different sets of brain data by changing a few thresholds . 
 the contribution of this work is the introduction of a straightforward and robust pipeline which annotates axoplasmic reticula with high precision , contributing towards advancements in automatic feature annotations in neural em data . +    2
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: taking advantage of quantum effects in meson decays provides a unique window on the mechanics of such decays . the dalitz plot analysis technique  @xcite is a unique way to measure decay amplitudes and phases . not only are these valuable inputs and a challenge to qcd , but also these parameters are necessary to extract fundamental parameters . specifically see jean - pierre lees contribution to these proceedings on the measurement of the ckm angle @xmath2 in charged @xmath3 decays using a dalitz plot analysis of @xmath4 .    in threshold production via resonance decays , the favored method for @xmath5 meson factories , the product mesons are in an eigenstate of  c. specifically the decay of the @xmath1 produced in @xmath5 collisions are  c  @xmath6 . this introduces correlations between the decays of the @xmath0 mesons produced in the @xmath1 decay . these depend on amplitudes for doubly cabibbo suppressed(dcs ) decays , @xmath0-mixing parameters , and strong phases all of which can be measured in samples of @xmath1 decays in which both @xmath0 decays have been identified as a flavor tag , a semileptonic decay , or a cp eigenstate  @xcite . i review results presented since the 2005 summer conference season . there are not a large number with all of them being preliminary results from the cleo collaboration . the various versions of the experiment are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . the work discussed here is based on 9/fb of @xmath5 data collected by the cleo - iii detector operating in the region of the @xmath7 , and 281/pb of @xmath5data collected by the cleo - c detector operating at the @xmath1 , corresponding to 1.4 million @xmath8 pairs . the motivation for this analysis is to measure the strong phase in @xmath10 decays . a constraint on this phase can be used in the measurement of the ckm angle @xmath2 in charged @xmath3 decays as discussed here  @xcite . the analysis is done with cleo - iii data and the @xmath11 s are produced in continuum production with their flavor tagged by the charge of the soft pion in charged @xmath12 decays . the sample is about 600 events with a signal to noise of about two to one . for the dalitz plot analysis the charges are swapped such that all the decays are treated as if a @xmath11 is decaying . the dalitz plot as shown in figure  [ fig : kkpi0dalitz ]        shows clear contributions from both charges of @xmath13 plus an oppositely charged @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the contributions to the dalitz plot are adequately described by just these three contributions plus a non - resonant amplitude which is assumed to be uniform in phase space and have a fixed phase which does not interfere with the resonant amplitudes . the projections of the dalitz plot on the three mass combinations are shown in figure  [ fig : kkpi0dalitz ] along with the result of a fit with the contributions described above . many systematic effects are considered . the largest effects are caused by considering other resonance contributions to the dalitz plot . none are found to be significant , but they do change the central values for the clearly observed resonances . the background is modeled with mass and mass difference side bands that are then fit to second order two - dimensional polynomials . allowing the parameters describing the background to vary is the next largest systematic uncertainty . the efficiency across the dalitz plot is modeled with a simulated sample that is generated uniformly across the dalitz plot and those passing all the analysis selections are fit to a two dimensional second order polynomial . again allowing these parameters to vary provide the third largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty . the effect of varying analysis details and procedures on the systematic uncertainty is small compared to the three effects described above . the analysis is preliminary . table  [ tab : kkpi0dalitz ] gives the    [ cols=""<,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ tab : tqca2 ]    for mixing and dcs parameters and the strong phase from the full analysis compared with the present knowledge from other experiments . while at this stage the analysis is not competitive cleo projects that with their full data set it will be producing results with a precision similar to world averages and with an orthogonal set of systematic uncertainties . this analysis depends on the assumption that the @xmath0 pairs observed from the @xmath1 are in the c  @xmath6 state , and they preliminarily measure the rate of cp@xmath16 states from @xmath1 decay at @xmath17 , where the error is only statistical . theoretical expectations are orders of magnitude below this . quantum correlations in charm decays provide a unique opportunity to study the details of decay dynamics . here i have shown two recent dalitz analyses that build on previous work and are probing strong phases and strong dynamics at new levels of precision . also i have shown how quantum correlations in threshold production give unique leverage and provide alternative ways to measure rare behavior in the charm sector . we can hope that results in this fascinating field continue to multiply to enlighten and challenge our colleagues . thanks to the organizers for a very well run , interesting , and enjoyable conference . specific thanks to jeff appel , david asner , and chris hearty . my research activities are supported by the u.s . national science foundation . g. viehhauser _ cleo iii operation _ , methods a * 462 * , 146 ( 2001 ) and r.a .

TEXT: for geometric frustrated magnetic materials it is impossible to choose one conguration with minimal energy by the individual minimization of the magnetic moments interactions . consequently , their ground states are degenerated . the most studied cases are systems with crystalline structures composed by triangles and tetrahedrons with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction of their magnetic moments  @xcite . recently frustration has been observed in jarosites and pyrochlore oxides as a result of ferromagnetic interaction  @xcite . in these structures the spins are arranged in kagom and pyrochlore lattices and forced to point in towards the center of the triangles and tetrahedrons respectively . for this reason , there is only the two possible states , `` in '' or `` out '' , and therefore can be approximated through the classical ising model . since the angle between the spins the ferro - antiferromagnetic rule is changed so ferromagnetic systems can be mapped by the antiferromagnetic ising model and vice - versa  @xcite . these systems are called spin ice because of the similarity between their ground state conguration and the pauli model for the water ice . due to the simplicity of the ising model in comparison with heisenberg they became a model for the study of geometric frustration . in some cases it is even possible an analytic treatment in order to compare to experimental and computational results  @xcite . the recent artificial production of the first spin ices in the square and honeycomb lattices had attracted a lot of attention  @xcite . they are constructed with bi - dimensional sequences of nanoislands with ferromagnetic magnetic moments considered as effective ising spins . recently it was possible to produce artificial jarosite and volborthite crystals with practically no distortions or impurities , something not possible for natural materials found in nature  @xcite . another recent example of the ising model is the study of magnetic materials in the triangular kagom lattice , artificially produced , as an alternative for adiabatic demagnetization  @xcite . they consist of a kagom lattice with an inserted site between two nearest - neighbors . additionally it can be used in the study of the exchange coupling constants  @xcite . they are composed of sequences kagom lattices with weak interaction between the layers so they are considered bidimensional structures . in this paper it is presented an alternative to the conventional representation of the kagom  @xcite and pyrochlore  @xcite lattices for monte carlo study of spins systems . furthermore , the critical temperatures and exponents using the standard ferromagnetic ising model is shown . as suggested , there are the studies of the xy and heisenberg models for these lattices or the addition of the dipolar term in the ising model  @xcite . there is also the possibility of the study of critical quantities and phase diagram for diluted cases . the kagom lattice is a two - dimensional arrangement of sites with four nearest - neighbors as shown in figure  [ fig : kagome ] . the unitary cell in gray has three sites with bonds forming equilateral triangles , each site in an indenpendent rhombic sublattices labeled a , b and c. for a site with label @xmath0 and coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 its nearest - neighbors are defined using the two versors *  * and *  * as shown in table  [ tab : kag_neighbors ] ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a , b and c respectivelly ) . the sites are indexed by @xmath6 , the space between the sites are set to 1 and @xmath7 . .nearest - neighbors for the kagom lattice .

TEXT: recent results from reverberation - mapping of the broad emission - line regions ( blr ) in agn indicate that the blr distance from the central radiation source roughly scales as @xmath1 ( peterson 1995 ) . recently we have elaborated a different method for estimating the blr distance , using the emission - line photoionization model . in order to explain the anticorrelation between the h@xmath2 line width and the soft x - ray spectral slope in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) ( boller , brandt and fink 1996 ; wang , brinkmann and bergeron 1996 ) , wandel and boller ( 1997 ) showed that a steeper spectrum would produce a blr at a relatively larger distance from the central source , so the keplerian velocity is lower . this modified blr distance calculated from the photoionization relation agrees well with the reverberation distance ( wandel 1996 ; 1997 ) . in this work we connect this model to the r(blr )  @xmath3 relation by independently determining the central mass from the x - ray variability . if the emission lines are doppler - broadened by keplerian motion in the gravitational potential of the central mass , the full width at half maximum is given by : @xmath4 where m is the mass of the central black hole and r the radius of the emission line region . the physical conditions in the ionized gas emitting the broad lines are characterized by the ionization parameter u , the ratio of ionizing photons to electrons @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the luminosity of the central source , per unit energy , @xmath7 is the electron density . the radius of the blr may then be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ionizing luminosity , and @xmath10 is the mean energy of the ionizing photons . typical values in agn clouds give @xmath11 ( cf . rees , netzer & ferland 1989 ) . for @xmath12 ( 2 ) gives @xmath13 where @xmath10 is in rydbergs . assuming the ionizing spectrum has a power - law shape with the spectral index of the soft x - ray band ( found e.g. from the rosat data ) , @xmath14 , gives the observed anti - correlation between the line width and the spectral index ( wandel and boller 1997 ) . wandel ( 1996 ; 1997 ) has shown that the blr radius calculated from eq . ( 2 ) above does indeed agree well with the radius estimates available from reverberation calculations for about a dozen objects ( see kaspi et.al . 1996 and these proceedings ) . we present an independent derivation of the radius - luminosity relation , determining the mass from x - ray variability . an upper limit for the black hole mass is given by ( e.g. wandel & mushotzky 1986 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is in seconds . this relation assumes that the bulk of the x - ray continuum is emitted within 5 schwarzschild radii . using the doubling time as the characteristic time for variability we determine upper limits for the black hole mass for those objects whose continuum luminosities have been observed to vary significantly . 1 gives the doubling time ( we have extrapolated amplitude variations linearly to a factor of 2 to determine @xmath16 ) versus the observed fwhm . although there is some scatter , there is a strong indication for an increase of the doubling time with observed fwhm . this may indicate a relation between the central mass and the line width . we may use eq . ( 1 ) to establish an estimate for the blr radius calculated from the observed line width and x - ray variability , independent of the luminosity , which can test the r - l@xmath17 relation : @xmath18 note that this is an upper limit , as is eq . ( 4 ) . the diamonds in figure 2 show the blr radius calculated from eq . ( 5 ) vs. the x - ray luminosity for the objects in our sample with significant x - ray variability and a few objects from wandel and mushotzky ( 1986 ) . we see that there is no correlation between r and l. on the other hand , as expected , the blr radius calculated from the photoionization model ( eq . 3 ) shows a clear @xmath19 correlation ( circles in figure 2 ) , which is confirmed independently by reverberatiom mapping . looking at figure 2 we may conclude that the x - ray variability method systematically overestimates the central mass for the low luminosity nls1 galaxies .
SUMMARY:we developed a new method of determination of the size of the broad emission - line region ( blr ) in active galactic nuclei . 
 this method relates the radius of the broad - line region of agn to the soft x - ray luminosity and spectral index . comparing the blr distances calculated from our model to the blr distances determined by reverberation mapping 
 shows that our scaling law agrees with the @xmath0 empirical relation . 
 here we investigate a complimentary method of estimating the blr distance - based on the keplerian broadening of the emission lines and the central mass estimated from x - ray variability .

TEXT: optically to date phase - resolved observations of the crab pulsar have been restricted to rudimentary 2-d or single pixel photometers , with variable temporal accuracy . successes worthy of note include the detection of an unpulsed component by peterson et al . ( 1978 ) , and strong polarisation behaviour as a function of phase - most especially for this same unpulsed component ( smith et al . 1988 ) . true characterisation of this interesting feature requires multi - band high speed 2-d photometry at @xmath3sec resolution , allowing for the acquisition of accurate phase - resolved photometry . we outline an analysis of such observations made of the crab pulsar using the triffid high speed photometer ( golden & shearer , 1999 ) . the triffid camera incorporating a mama detector was used to observe the crab pulsar over 5 nights in january 1996 on the 6 m telescope in the russian caucasus . using the jodrell crab ephemeris ( lyne & pritchard , 1996 ) , photons within specific phase regions were selected to produce a sequence of phase - resolved images over the pulsar s light curve . figure 1 shows such a sequence , and confirms the reported constant emission . via standard image reduction techniques , the relative fluxes per light curve component per colour band were determined , and normalized to archival integrated estimates ( percival et al . flux components per colour band are plotted in figure 1 , and a weighted least squares fit to the unpulsed components indicate a power - law exponent of -0.6 @xmath2 0.4 , the reference integrated photometry contributing most of the associated error . we have resolved constant emission from the ` off ' phase of the crab light curve . phenomenologically , the emission is nonthermal and _ steeper _ than that observed for the peaks , although similar to that of the bridge component . whether it is directly related to the latter , or is a consequence of magnetospheric scattering is not clear . further observations of this & the vela pulsar may show evidence for a similar unpulsed component of emission , which as yet remains inexplicable in terms of contemporary high energy emission theory .
SUMMARY:using the high speed 2-d triffid photometer , we have obtained phase resolved photometry of the crab pulsar in @xmath0 that allows us to flux the unpulsed light curve component . following de - extinction , weighted least - square fitting indicates a power - law exponent of @xmath1 = -0.62 @xmath2 0.49 . this is steeper than that reported for the peak components and its origin

TEXT: past wf attacks employed new combinations of ml classifiers and feature sets to defeat defenses . we showed that a bayes error lower bound estimate bounds the error of a wf adversary using a certain feature set , regardless his choice of a classifier . on this basis we introduced privacy metric for wf defenses , based on , that indicates how far a defense is from a perfectly private one . we discuss open questions and future directions . our work justifies wf research to shift its focus towards features . it further gives a tool to help future studies in this direction : the error estimate , a lower bound of the error of any adversary using a certain feature set , can also be used to evaluate feature sets independently of a classifier ( ) . whilst our results suggest that finding better performing features is becoming harder , we recognize that one limitation of is its dependence on a set of features . future research may attempt to formulate a similar guarantee independently of features . we call such a guarantee , which is defined as follows . let @xmath0 be the range of a defense . let @xmath1 be the set of all the features that can be extracted from @xmath2 . then is if it is and for any @xmath3 , which guarantees @xmath4-privacy , holds : @xmath5 for an arbitrary @xmath6 ; that is , is if the value of @xmath7 achieved by a feature set is proven to be the smallest up to some negligible additive term @xmath8 . whilst recent wf research attempted to optimize the computational time and storage required to perform attacks , researchers have not imposed computational bounds to wf adversaries . we suggest that time and memory computational bounds should be imposed to feature extraction and classification . we remark although that the bayes error is optimal , for any computationally unbounded adversary .    in the context of feature sets , we suggest future research to direct its attention towards _ efficient _ feature sets , as we shall now define . let @xmath9 be the bayes error committed when using full information . an efficient feature set @xmath10 is a feature set that satisfies both :            we opted for a well - studied asymptotic lower bound estimate of the bayes error , which is based on the error of the nn classifier . future work may explore other estimates in order to obtain tighter bounds . unfortunately , under the relaxed i.i.d . assumption on data , it is not possible to prove any convergence rate result for a bayes error estimate  @xcite ; we will thus need to evaluate convergence experimentally for any estimate .    when the true distributions are known , however , it is possible to compute the bayes error directly . for example , a recent probabilistic defense , alpaca , samples web pages characteristics from known distributions . in this case , it may be possible to estimate the bayes error @xmath14 directly from such distributions  @xcite .      both and are valid metrics for evaluating the privacy of a defense against wf attacks . , which is related to the concept of advantage widely used in cryptography , gives a more precise idea of how far a defense is from a perfect one ( that is , one that forces an adversary into random guessing ) , and should thus be preferred to evaluate the security of defenses . may be used for comparing features . it is common to engineer wf attacks with respect to their false positives ( fp ) and false negatives ( fn ) rates . these quantities provide insight about the precision of attacks . whilst we acknowledge that fp - fn are essential for evaluating wf attacks in real - world scenarios , we suggest that the privacy of a defense is best described by just one security parameter . nevertheless , future research may extend our method to these notions . the simplicity of our approach suggests that other applications in traffic analysis may benefit from it . in fact , the method evaluates the ability of a defense to protect the underlying behavior of any source of data : provided that an attack is based on an ml classifier , we can bound the success rate of any adversary .    more generally , future research may apply this method to evaluate the security against other ml - based attacks . if an adversary uses an ml classifier to violate security properties , we can immediately estimate security bounds for the proposed countermeasures . furthermore , we remark that if the information available to the adversary in this context was limited ( i.e. , data comes from a low dimensional space ) , the estimated bounds would be feature - independent . we showed that there exist natural bounds on any wf adversary , and that we can estimate and use them to evaluate the privacy of any wf defense in a black - box manner . we expect this will be used to evaluate the privacy of padding schemes in protocols such as tor , ssh , and tls . we hope our work inspires further research towards formalizing and defining security for wf and ta attacks , for even more realistic adversaries ( e.g. , computationally bounded adversaries ) . we suspect this will help moving from to . nonetheless , we reiterate that our framework already provides security guarantees , and that it allows future proposals and evaluations of wf defenses to only focus on the state - of - the - art features in order to show their privacy .
SUMMARY:website fingerprinting ( wf ) attacks raise major concerns about users privacy . 
 they employ machine learning ( ml ) to allow a local passive adversary to uncover the web browsing behavior of a user , even if she browses through an encrypted tunnel ( e.g. tor , vpn ) . 
 numerous defenses have been proposed in the past ; however , it is typically difficult to have formal guarantees on their security , which is most often evaluated empirically against state - of - the - art attacks . in this paper 
 , we present a practical method to derive security bounds for any wf defense , which depend on a chosen feature set . 
 this result derives from reducing wf attacks to an ml classification task , where we can determine the smallest achievable error ( the bayes error ) ; such error can be estimated in practice , and is a lower bound for a wf adversary , for any classification algorithm he may use . 
 our work has two main consequences : i ) it allows determining the security of wf defenses , in a black - box manner , with respect to the state - of - the - art feature set and ii ) it favors shifting the focus of future wf research to the identification of optimal feature sets . 
 the generality of the approach further suggests that the method could be used to define security bounds for other ml - based attacks .    [ cols=""<,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]

TEXT: we present the characteristics and performances of a demonstrative experiment devoted to the observation of ultra high- energy cosmic rays extensive air showers using a radiodetection technique . the codalema ( cosmic ray detection array with logarithmic electromagnetic antennas ) experiment was set up at the nanay radio observatory in 2003 . it uses 6 of the 144 log - periodic antennas ( in the 1 - 100  mhz frequency band for codalema ) constituting the decametric array ( dam ) @xcite .    in the first period of observation @xcite , the setup ( see fig .

TEXT: white dwarf envelope models with steady hydrogen burning have been calculated for realistic compositions of white dwarf envelopes in classical novae , and their evolution has been approximated as a sequence of steady states . three chemical compositions for one novae have been considered , corresponding to models from @xcite with 25% , 50% and 75% mixing between the solar accreted matter and the degenerate core . results show that , for a given white dwarf mass and composition , the envelope evolves in the hr diagram increasing its effective temperature along a plateau of quasi - constant luminosity , while its mass slowly decreases due to hydrogen burning . when the envelope mass is reduced to the minimum value for steady hydrogen burning , the source turns - off . this occurs just when the maximum effective temperature is reached . both the luminosity and the envelope mass during the plateau depend on the white dwarf mass and hydrogen mass fraction . the behaviors of luminosity and envelope mass as a function of white dwarf mass and hydrogen mass fraction can be approximated by the expressions    @xmath0    @xmath1 we have compared @xcite results on the soft component of v1974 cyg ( nova cygni 1992 ) during the plateau phase with our steady hydrogen burning white dwarf envelope models . in fig . [ figures ] , the @xmath2 contours of the spectral parameters found by balman , krautter , & gelman ( 1998 ) are plotted over the photospheric radius - effective temperature results from our envelope models with 25% and 50% mixing . for each model , the lower panels show the corresponding envelope mass with the time intervals ( in days ) for quasi - static evolution . it is clear that the large error bars on the photospheric radius , due to the uncertainty on the distance , prevent any clear comparison with the value predicted by the models . nevertheless , the comparison of the observed evolution of the effective temperature alone with the models indicates that the soft x - ray emission of v1974 cyg is compatible with the evolution of an envelope with steady hydrogen burning , on either a 0.9 m@xmath3 white dwarf with 50% mixing , or 1.0 m@xmath3 with 25% mixing . note that this comparison based on the effective temperature is independent from the distance determination .    in any case , the envelope mass for stable hydrogen burning ( @xmath4 m@xmath3 ) is much smaller than the mass needed to trigger the nova outburst for these masses and compositions ( @xmath5 m@xmath3 , jos & hernanz 1998 ) . as the ejected fraction , according to hydrodynamical models , is not sufficient to reduce the envelope mass down to the values for stable hydrogen burning , it is clear that some extra mass loss mechanism must be present after the outburst .
SUMMARY:detection of x - ray emission from classical novae in their post - outburst stages provides crucial information about the nova phenomenon . 
 the soft x - ray emission gives a direct insight into the remaining hot nuclear burning shell . 
 a numerical model for steady h - burning white dwarf envelopes has been developed to study the post - outburst phases of classical novae . 
 properties of the x - ray emission of the post - nova white dwarf are obtained , and the results are compared to rosat observations of v1974 cyg .

TEXT: in @xcite oshiro proved that colors @xmath4 and @xmath5 can always be removed from a non - trivial @xmath6-coloring . we mimic oshiro s approach to prove the following . [ thm : main ] let @xmath7 be a prime . let @xmath8 be a non - split link which admits non - trivial @xmath0-colorings . then colors @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are not needed in order to assemble a non - trivial @xmath0-coloring of @xmath8 . we now give an outline of the proof . we consider a diagram endowed with a non - trivial ( 2k+1)-coloring . for each color , @xmath9 , to be removed the strategy is the following . first we check if the color is used in the coloring . if it is not we are done . else we consider the following three possibilities , in turn . the first is to ascertain if the color @xmath9 is used in a monochromatic crossing . if it is not we go to the next step . else we remove the color @xmath9 from each monochromatic crossing in the diagram until there is no monochromatic crossing involving color @xmath9 . the next step is to check if @xmath9 is used in an over - arc . if it is not we go to the next step . else we remove @xmath9 from each over - arc until there is no over - arc with color @xmath9 . finally we check if @xmath9 is used in an under - arc . if it is not we are done . else we remove it from each under - arc until there is no under - arc using color @xmath9 . this ends the removal of color @xmath9 from the coloring . the actual removal of the color at each step is done by performing reidemeister moves on the diagram and consistently re - assigning colors in the neighborhoods affected by the transformations . the proof is split into three sections . in section [ sect:2k ] we show how to remove @xmath10 ; in section [ sect : remove2k-1 ] we show how to remove color @xmath11 , provided color @xmath10 is no longer being used ; and in section [ sect : removek ] we show how to remove color @xmath3 provided colors @xmath10 and @xmath11 are no longer being used .    in the sequel , in any figure the right - most diagram is the candidate to a diagram without the color under scrutiny , see figure [ fig : eps1 ] below , for example . for that the colors in the new arcs are analyzed . these colors are forced to equal the forbidden colors so that we identify the new situations we have to tackle . in the first cases we do the explicit calculations but later on we rely on displaying in tables the forbidden identities ( in the first row ) and their consequences ( in the second row ) . these consequences can be either an inconsistency ( which is marked by an @xmath12 ) and we can dismiss the situation , or an expression which helps us identify the new situation to be tackled . these new situations , in turn , are dealt with below in the text . we remark also that the inconsistencies are of the sort `` arc assuming a forbidden color '' or `` @xmath13 a prime less than @xmath14 or a composite integer '' , among others .    * expressions and equalities will be understood modulo @xmath15*. view figure [ fig : eps1 ] . we remark that the details of some crossings are irrelevant for the reasonings here . since we are trying to remove color @xmath10 we would not want @xmath16 in the diagram on the right - hand side to equal @xmath10 . let us look into the consequences of such identity . if @xmath17 then @xmath18 which amounts to @xmath19 . but if there is no pair of crossings in the diagram as depicted in figure [ fig : eps1 ] such that @xmath20 , then the whole coloring is monochromatic which conflicts with the standing assumption of a non - trivial coloring . ( this corresponds to the inconsistencies we discussed above . below in the tables these instances will be marked with an @xmath12 . ) hence , by repeating this operation we can assume we remove all the monochromatic crossings with color @xmath10 .      view figure [ fig : eps2 ] . we have already seen that @xmath21 is equivalent to @xmath22 and we now note that @xmath21 is also equivalent to @xmath23 . in this way we have achieved the goal of removing color @xmath10 from over - arcs . .equalities which should not occur in figure [ fig : eps3 ] ( 1st row ) and their consequences ( 2nd row ) . these situations are dealt with in [ subsubsect:2kunderb2a+1 ] and [ subsubsect:2kunderba ] below .

SUMMARY:we prove that if a link admits non - trivial @xmath0-colorings , with prime @xmath1 , it also admits non - trivial @xmath0-colorings not involving colors @xmath2 , nor @xmath3 .

 flux densities are found by means of peak - finding and the fitting of a gaussian point - response function . with highly - confused images , 
 careful checks must be made on the completeness and flux density accuracy of the detected sources . 
 this is done by injecting artificial sources into the images and analysing the resulting catalogues . measured flux densities at which 50 per cent of injected sources result in good detections at ( 250 , 350 , 500)@xmath0 m range from ( 11.6 , 13.2 , 13.1)mjy to ( 25.7 , 27.1 , 35.8)mjy , depending on the depth of the observation ( where a ` good ' detection is taken to be one with positional offset less than one full - width half - maximum of the point - response function , and with the measured flux density within a factor of 2 of the flux density of the injected source ) .

[ fig : permanent ] and [ fig : transient ] . the upper bound on the coupling @xmath16 , coming from the @xmath20 constraint on @xmath15 , as well as the lower bound on the potential parameter @xmath5 , resulting from the bound on the amount of dark energy during bbn , is also shown in the figures ( horizontal and vertical dashed lines , respectively ) . decreasing @xmath16 or increasing @xmath5 prolongs the kinetic regime . if this regime is too long , the history of the universe is spoiled . this allows us to put a lower and an upper bound on @xmath16 and @xmath5 , respectively . from the complete numerical analysis we find that the model exhibits transient acceleration at late times for @xmath21 @xmath22 while permanent acceleration is obtained for @xmath23 @xmath24    the number of @xmath25-folds from horizon crossing till the end of inflation @xmath15 and the value for the 5d planck mass are very constrained : @xmath26 which imposes strong constraints on the inflationary observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 . we have analyzed a simple model of quintessential inflation in the rsii braneworld context with a modified exponential potential . assuming that the universe was reheated via the instant preheating mechanism , we have shown that the evolution of the scalar field from inflation till the present epoch is consistent with the observations in a wide region of the parameter space . requiring that the model meets various cosmological constraints at the different stages of the evolution , we were able to constrain tightly its parameters , as summarized in eqs .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: for the study of the structure of the present day universe on very large scales ( @xmath3 mpc ) the use of galaxy clusters constitutes a very interesting alternative to the conventional galaxy redshift surveys for several reasons . one can study a larger volume with a smaller number of objects . the spatial correlation in the cluster distribution is strongly magnified with respect to the galaxy and to the mass distribution ( kaiser 1984 ) . the biasing factor relating the cluster distribution power spectrum to the mass density fluctuations can be calculated _ ab - initio _ ( e.g. bardeen et al . 1986 , mo & white , 1996 ) . x - ray astronomy offers a unique tool to efficiently detect and characterize galaxy clusters out to large distances . originating in the hot intracluster plasma that fills the gravitational potential well of the clusters , the x - ray emission is an equally robust parameter for a mass estimate of a clusters as the galaxy velocity dispersion . with the survey described here , named rosat eso flux limited x - ray ( reflex ) cluster survey , we exploit the unique opportunity provided by the rosat all - sky survey ( trmper 1993 , voges et al . 1996 ) to construct a cluster sample for cosmological studies . the cluster candidates found are then optically identified and redshifts are measured in the frame of an eso key programme ( bhringer 1994 , guzzo et al . in the rosat all - sky survey atlas only the brightest and well extended x - ray cluster sources are readily identified , while the main part of the identifications has to be based on further optical information . for a first identification we use the cosmos data base ( e.g. heydon - dumbleton et al . 1989 ) , originating from the uk schmidt survey , providing star / galaxy separation down to @xmath4 mag . the price paid for a high completeness ( low detection threshold ) is a contamination of the candidate list by more than 30% non - cluster sources . this contamination is reduced by a direct inspection of the photographic plates , the detailed x - ray properties , and the available literature information . the residual contamination ( up to 10% ) is generally recognized and discarded in the follow - up observations , which will be completed at the end of the year 1998 . presently we have constructed a first catalogue of bright clusters down to an x - ray flux limit of @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( in the rosat band 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) comprising 475 objects . interestingly , only 53% of these clusters are found in the aco catalogue ( abell , corwin , & olowin , 1989 ) and further 10% in the supplementary list , while most of the others were previously unknown ( e.g. fig . the following results are based on the sample of 475 x - ray bright clusters ( with 413 cluster redshifts obtained so far ) . a plot of the number counts of the population as a function of x - ray flux is shown in fig .  2 . the logarithmic graph is well described by an euclidian slope of -3/2 . this is expected for such nearby clusters with a median redshift of @xmath6 . the x - ray luminosity function is a very important characteristic of the sample , since it is most closely related to the mass function of the clusters and used as an important calibrator of the amplitude of the cosmic density fluctuation power spectrum ( e.g. white et al . 1993 ) . a preliminary version of the reflex x - ray luminosity function is shown in fig . the function was computed when ( @xmath7 ) of the redshifts had been determined . but it already recovers the densities reached in previous surveys ( e.g. de grandi 1996 , ebeling et al . 1997 ) as shown in fig . despite the present incompleteness in redshifts which we essentially hope to fill by scheduled observations till the end of 1998 , the high quality and completeness of the data set is already reflected in the present results . the large volume covered and the high accuracy of the sample makes the reflex survey ideal for the study of the large - scale structure . an extended reflex sample down to a flux limit of @xmath8 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 is prepared and redshifts are available for more than 70% of the objects . this set will contain about 750 clusters . finally , a complementary rosat survey cluster identification programme is being conducted in the northern sky in a collaboration of mpe and j. huchra , r. giacconi , p. rosati and b. mclean which will soon reach a similar depth and provide an all - sky view on the x - ray cluster distribution .
SUMMARY:based on the rosat all - sky survey we have conducted a large redshift survey as an eso key programme to identify and secure redshifts for the x - ray brightest clusters found in the southern hemisphere . 
 we present first results for a highly controlled sample for a flux limit of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) comprising 475 clusters ( 87% with redshifts ) . 
 the logn - logs function of the sample shows an almost perfect euclidian slope and a preliminary x - ray luminosity function is presented .

66,"You are an expert at summarization. Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: in year 2012 , @xcite discovered a small cloud , later named `` g2 '' , at few thousands schwarzschild radii from sgra*. g2 has both a dust component , visible in the near infrared @xmath3 band , and a gaseous component , visible in br@xmath4 and other recombination lines . the cloud lies on a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath5 ) and reached its pericenter in early 2014 , with a distance from sgra * of @xmath6 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath7 ) . the line emission shows an increasing spatial extent and a broadening in the velocity space , interpreted as tidal stretching of the cloud by the tidal field of sgra * @xcite . observed position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams and br@xmath4 maps also show the presence of a tail ( g2 t ) , following g2 on roughly the same orbit @xcite . we performed 3d adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic simulations with the code pluto to understand whether g2 s gas component can be the outflow of a central source . we start the source at apocenter and let it move on the best - fit orbit derived by @xcite . we include an idealized adaf - like atmosphere and the gravitational field of sgra * ( @xmath8 ) . the outflow initially expands with a spherical shape and stalls due to pressure balance . close to pericenter , the ram pressure of the atmosphere and the tidal force of the smbh increase . this leads to the stripping of the rayleigh - taylor fingers of shocked outflow material and to the stretching of the cloud ( see fig . we compare to observations by constructing mock position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams . for relatively high mass - loss rates ( @xmath0 ) and low velocity ( @xmath9 ) , the shocked outflow material can reasonably reproduce g2 in the observed pv diagrams , as in the case of the _ diffuse cloud scenario _ ( see conference contribution by marc schartmann ) . for same mass - loss rate , but higher velocity ( @xmath10 ) , the external ram pressure is more effective and the stripped material accumulates in the trailing region , forming a long tail ( see fig . the simulated pv diagrams , in the latter case , result in a bimodal emission ( see fig . 1c and * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion ) . in the latter scenario , g2 would be produced by the leading stagnation shock of the outflow and g2 t by the long tail of stripped material . as in the case of previous studies @xcite , our best matching parameters seem to suggest a massive outflow , typical of young stellar objects such as t tauri stars ( as already suggested by * ? ? * see also the conference contribution by michal zajaek ) . a t tauri star is also appealing , since it could naturally explain the presence of dust embedded in g2 . the nature of g2 remains an open question ; however , in the case of a compact source , we should be able to observe a decoupling between the source and the previous outflow ( i.e. , between the dust and gas components ) in the next 5 - 10 years ( see fig . a new g2 should reform around the source , later on .
SUMMARY:we study the evolution of g2 in a _ compact source scenario _ , where g2 is the outflow from a low - mass central star moving on the observed orbit . 
 this is done through 3d amr simulations of the hydrodynamic interaction of g2 with the surrounding hot accretion flow . 
 a comparison with observations is done by means of mock position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams . 
 we found that a massive ( @xmath0 ) and slow ( @xmath1 ) outflow can reproduce g2 s properties . a faster outflow ( @xmath2 ) might also be able to explain the material that seems to follow g2 on the same orbit .

TEXT: the sm electro - weak gauge group is extended from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . the model lagrangian density that represents this gauge group is written in a general form as a sum of    = _ esm+_st , [ lag ] where the enlarged standard model ( esm ) part is defined by    @xmath5    which represents a modified sm , obtained by introducing a new @xmath6 boson field @xmath7 and the field tensor @xmath8 . this field is coupled to the other sm bosons in the covariant derivative @xcite    [ derivada ] d_= _ + i g_2 w^a_+i g_y b_+i g_c c _ ,    where @xmath9 is the usual higgs field .    the stueckelberg dark sector lagrangian is written as @xcite _ st&=&-x_x^ -(_+m_1 c_+m_2 x_)^2 + l _ , [ dm ]    where the new @xmath6 vector boson in the dark sector is @xmath10 with its field tensor @xmath11 . the second term in ( [ dm ] ) is the stueckelberg coupling term between the two boson fields @xmath12 and @xmath10 via an axial pseudo - scalar @xmath13 field . the @xmath13 field is unphysical and decouples from all fields after gauge fixing . the last term @xmath14 is a general fermion term of the dark sector . this type of model was first proposed by ref . @xcite , but with just one dark field , and was applied as well in ref . @xcite . using this full lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and taking into account just the terms that contribute to the bosons masses , we obtain    ^=  - v^t m^2 v _ ,    where @xmath15 and the mass matrix is    m^2=    cccc[matriz ] m_2 ^ 2 & m_1 m_2 & 0 & 0 + m_1 m_2 & m_1 ^ 2 + & g_c g_y v^2 & - g_2 g_c v^2 + 0 & g_c g_y v^2 & & - g_2 g_y v^2 + 0 & - g_2 g_c v^2 & - g_2 g_y v^2 & [ mass ]    . it is interesting to note that a new orthogonal matrix @xmath16 can be obtained such that it diagonalizes ( [ mass ] ) and transforms the basis from the unphysical fields @xmath17 into the real fields @xmath18 . after diagonalizing the matrix ( [ matriz ] ) we obtain @xmath19 mass eigenvalues . they are     m_z^2,m_z^2&= & + m_^2 & = & 0 ; m_a^2 = 0 . where = . we identify the masses with the @xmath2 and @xmath0 bosons masses . one of the zero eigenvalues can be associated , as usual , to the photon and the other one to a new massless boson , which we shall call a _ dark photon _ @xmath20 .    the @xmath2 mass can be expanded in terms of @xmath21 , this introduces a correction that rises this mass value by small quantity @xmath22 defined as = -    where = ; m_c = ; m_y = , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . we can compare this correction with the uncertainty in the value of @xmath2 mass , @xmath25gev @xcite . for parameter ajustments , we set the @xmath0 mass in two values @xcite : @xmath26 gev and @xmath27gev , then vary the @xmath28 parameter over the range @xmath29 . the possible values for these parameters are shown in the figure [ f1 ] .    . , width=377 ]    the possible values for @xmath21 are acceptable considering that this range of values is smaller than the usual values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , turning the term associated with the field @xmath12 very small , as expected . the next steps are to calculate decays and annihilations of particles from dark side into known particles . this work was supported by cnpq .
SUMMARY:we investigate a double extension to the standard model ( sm ) . 
 a first extension introduces , via minimal coupling , a massive @xmath0 boson . 
 this enlarged sm is coupled to a dark matter sector through the stueckelberg mechanism by a @xmath1 boson . 
 however , the @xmath1 boson does not interact directly with the sm fermions . in our study 
 , we found that the @xmath1 is a massless photon - like particle in dark sector . 
 constraints on the mass for @xmath0 and corrections to @xmath2 mass are obtained .

TEXT: pulsar radio emission beam has been widely attempted to interpret in terms of emission in purely dipolar magnetic field . gangadhara & gupta ( 2001 ) have estimated the emission heights of different radio pulse components in psr  b0329 + 54 based on the aberration retardation phase shift , and the revised estimates are given by dyks , rudak , & harding ( 2003 ) . here we solve the viewing geometry and estimate the altitudes from which observer can receive the radio waves . consider a magnetic dipole situated at the origin with magnetic axis ( @xmath2 ) inclined by @xmath3 with respect to the rotation axis @xmath4 and rotated by @xmath5 around @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the line of sight , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the line of sight impact parameter .    in a relativistic flow , the emitted radiation is beamed in the direction of field line tangent @xmath10 , so at any instant the observed radiation comes from a spot in the magnetosphere where the tangent vector points in the direction @xmath11 of observer . for receiving such radiation the semi opening angle of emission beam @xmath12 must be approximately equal to the opening angle of field lines @xmath13 therefore , the magnetic _ colatitude _ @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 next , the magnetic _ azimuth _ @xmath16 of the emission point can be obtained by finding @xmath17 which is parallel to @xmath18 @xmath19 for @xmath20 on leading side the maximum value for @xmath21 allowed by the viewing geometry is @xmath22 which in turn allows to find the maximum pulse window @xmath23 where @xmath5 is the pulse phase at which @xmath21 approaches @xmath24 using @xmath25 and @xmath26 for psr  b0329 + 54 , we find @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29    pulsar radio emission is generally believed to be coherent curvature radiation by secondary pair plasma streaming along the dipolar magnetic field lines . the curvature emission peaks at the characteristic frequency ( e.g. , eq .  45 , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) . for a given frequency and a lorentz factor @xmath30 we can estimate the radius of curvature @xmath31 , which in tern allows to find the field line constant . so , using @xmath32 and 390 we estimated the emission height ( see , fig . 1a ) of radiation at 325 mhz and 606 mhz , respectively . on the other hand by accepting the emission heights derived from the aberration - retardation phase shift , we estimated @xmath1 and @xmath31 expected : @xmath33 @xmath34 for 325 mhz emission , and @xmath35 @xmath36 for 606 mhz . the polar cap with foot location of emission associated field lines is given in fig . 1b , where @xmath37axis is chosen to be parallel to @xmath38 and x to lie in the @xmath39-@xmath38 plane . it is nearly elliptical with radius of 164  m and 171  m in x and y directions .
SUMMARY:the beamed emission by relativistic sources moving along the magnetic dipolar field lines occur in the direction of tangents to the field lines . to receive such a beamed radiation 
 line - of - sight must align with the tangent within the beaming angle @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle lorentz factor . by solving the viewing geometry , in an inclined and rotating dipole magnetic field 
 , we show that at any given pulse phase observer can receive the radiation only from the specific altitudes . 
 we find the outer conal emission is received from the higher altitudes than the inner conal components including the core . at any pulse phase , low frequency emission comes from the higher altitudes than the high frequency emission . as an application of our model , we have applied it to explain the emission heights of conal components in psr  b0329 + 54 .

SUMMARY:meta - material , plasmonic crystal , dispersion relation , effective property , series solution , catalan number we obtain a convergent power series expansion for the first branch of the dispersion relation for subwavelength plasmonic crystals consisting of plasmonic rods with frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity embedded in a host medium with unit permittivity . 
 the expansion parameter is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the norm of a fixed wavevector , @xmath2 is the period of the crystal and @xmath3 is the wavelength , and the plasma frequency scales inversely to @xmath2 , making the dielectric permittivity in the rods large and negative . 
 the expressions for the series coefficients ( a.k.a . , dynamic correctors ) and the radius of convergence in @xmath4 
 are explicitly related to the solutions of higher - order cell problems and the geometry of the rods . within the radius of convergence , we are able to compute the dispersion relation and the fields and define dynamic effective properties in a mathematically rigorous manner . 
 explicit error estimates show that a good approximation to the true dispersion relation is obtained using only a few terms of the expansion . the convergence proof requires the use of properties of the catalan numbers to show that the series coefficients are exponentially bounded in the @xmath5 sobolev norm .

TEXT: the fact that many late b - type sb systems contain a hgmn star as a primary points out that it is very likely that most normal late b - type stars formed in close binary systems are hgmn stars ( hubrig & mathys 1996 ) . from a survey of hgmn stars in close sbs , hubrig & mathys ( 1995 ) suggested that some chemical elements might be inhomogeneously distributed on the surface , with , in particular , preferential concentration of mn around the rotation poles and of hg along the equator . in a recent study of the star araur which is the only known eclipsing binary with a hgmn primary we concluded that certain elements are very likely concentrated in a fractured ring along the rotational equator ( hubrig et al . also our recent survey of a large sample of hgmn stars using uves at the vlt and feros at the eso 2.2 m telescope to search for spectral variability caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of various elements on the surface of these stars revealed that most hgmn stars exhibit spectral variability of various chemical elements ( gonzlez et al . 2007 , in preparation ) . typically , inhomogeneous chemical abundance distributions are observed only on the surface of magnetic chemically peculiar stars with large - scale organized magnetic fields . weak magnetic fields in the atmospheres of hgmn stars have been detected by mathys & hubrig ( 1995 ) , hubrig & castelli ( 2001 ) , and more recently by hubrig et al . ( 2006b ) . the structure of the measured field in hgmn stars is expected to be , however , sufficiently tangled so that it does not produce a strong net observable circular polarization signature the role that magnetic fields possibly play in the development of anomalies in binary systems , has never been critically tested by astrophysical dynamos . hubrig ( 1998 ) suggested that the tidal torque varying with depth and latitude in a star induces differential rotation . differential rotation in a radiative star can , however , be prone to magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) ( e.g. , arlt et al . recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations revealed a distinct structure for the magnetic field topology similar to the fractured elemental rings observed on the surface of hgmn stars ( fig .  1 ) . complex surface patterns can be obtained from the nonlinear , non - axisymmetric evolution of the mri . the combination of differential rotation and a poloidal magnetic field was studied numerically by the spherical mhd code of hollerbach ( 2000 ) . the initial model differential rotation was hydrodynamically stable ( taylor - proudman flow ) , but the introduction of a magnetic field excites the mri . the flows and fields resulting from the instability efficiently redistribute angular momentum and deliver a uniformly rotating star after about 10 - 100myr . the presented typical patterns of the velocity and the magnetic field on the surface of the star may as well be an indication for element redistribution on ( or in ) the star .
SUMMARY:the important result achieved in our recent study of a large sample of hgmn stars using uves at the vlt and feros at the eso 2.2 m telescope is the finding that most hgmn stars exhibit spectral variability of various chemical elements , proving that the presence of an inhomogeneous distribution on the surface of these stars is a rather common characteristics and not a rare phenomenon .

TEXT: the aim of this paper is to present some details about the performance of the neutrino monte carlo generator of events developed at the wrocaw university . it differs from other generators ( e.g. neugen , nuance , neut ) @xcite in the treatment of the resonance region . our generator contains an explicit @xmath0 resonance excitation model but contributions from more massive resonances are absent . it is assumed that an average description of the cross section coming from those resonances is sufficient . in fact , in the low energy bnl data only the @xmath0 peak is clearly seen in all single pion production ( spp ) channels on free nucleon targets @xcite . in neutrino interactions with nucleus targets the fermi motion is supposed to average the cross section contributions from other then the @xmath0 resonance peaks . the performance of the wrocaw generator in the spp channels has been discussed elsewhere @xcite . the agreement with available data is satisfactory . in order to cover the entire allowed kinematical region it is necessary to apply the dis formalism to produce the events also for values of invariant hadronic mass @xmath1  gev . two problems arise then : ( i ) how to model the structure functions in order to reproduce the correct value of the inclusive cross section and ( ii ) how to produce the final states . the generally accepted way to describe the structure functions is to use bodek - yang low @xmath2 modifications , which have been introduced on the basis of the electron scattering data @xcite . recently the neutrino scattering data from the chorus and nutev experiments on nuclear targets ( iron and lead ) have become available @xcite and further progress and cross checks will be possible . in order to produce final hadronic states several strategies can be adopted . in our approach we assume that interactions take place on separate constituent of the nucleon . the first step of fragmentation is performed by our generator and of remaining quark - diquark system by means of pythia6 routines based on the lund model @xcite . several parameters of pythia6 were fine - tuned to get a good agreement with data @xcite . in effect it is possible to produce dis events for small values of the invariant hadronic mass down to the threshold for the single pion production @xmath3 . the low @xmath4 dis events are used in order to model the non - resonant background @xcite .

TEXT: the distribution of the duration of gamma - ray bursts shows an indication of two distinct groups from earlier experiments@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . data from burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) have confirmed the bimodal distribution of the duration of gamma - ray bursts . in terms of the parameter t90 , which is the time interval during which the integrated counts of a burst go from 5% to 95% of the total integrated counts , the bursts are separated into two groups around t90 @xmath0 2 s @xcite . time dilation , an evidence for the cosmological origin of grbs , was found in the long grbs @xcite . it is not yet known whether the two kinds of bursts are different or not . a recent study on the pulses in grbs suggests that the duration of the equivalent width of each pulse and the mean duration of individual pulse are bimodal @xcite . in this paper , we present a different approach to investigate the average pulse width of grbs . light curves of the batse grbs in 4b catalogue are studied . the light curves are from concatenated discla , preb and discsc data , and were obtained from compton observatory science support center ( cossc ) . they have been arranged into 64 ms time bins . first we subtract batse background from grb light curves . the batse background were estimated by a 5-degree polynomial . the total number of grbs with visually acceptable background estimate is 1186 . then we calculate the average pulse width @xmath1 of each grb as follows . first we calculate the auto - correlation of the light curve of each grb . the auto - correlation coefficients of the grb , @xmath2 , are defined as follows : @xmath3 where @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) the auto - correlation coefficient at @xmath5 . we define the average pulse width @xmath1 as @xmath6 where 0.25 represents the average time shift of the central bin of the auto - correlation coefficient a(0 ) , and @xmath7 the maximum of @xmath8 with @xmath9+@xmath2 no less than 0.0 in the main peak of the auto - correlation . + the auto - correlation coefficients of batse trigger no.143 is shown in fig.1 . the data in the shaded region is used to calculate @xmath1 . we calculate @xmath1 of each grb and study the distribution of the average pulse width of the 1186 grbs . we have obtained the following results from the study of the average pulse width @xmath1    * the distribution of @xmath1 of grb is bimodal . this suggests that the average pulse width is bimodally distributed , and grbs can be divided into two groups , namely shot - pulse bursts and long - pulse bursts . the distribution of @xmath1 is peaked at about 0.5 s and 14 s for the two groups , respectively . they are roughly separated around 2 s. this is shown in fig.2 . * the average pulse width of the dim long - pulse bursts are longer than the bright long - pulse bursts . however , the average pulse width of the short - pulse bursts does not show a simple relation with grb peak flux . this is shown in fig.3 . we have presented our preliminary analyses of 1186 batse grb light curves in order to study the bimodal distribution of the duration of grbs . we conclude    * the duration of the average pulse width in grbs are bimodally distributed . this is consistent with a different approach ( mitrofanov et al . * long - pulse bursts show the evidence for the time dilation effect . this is nt shown for the short - pulse bursts . further study of the short - pulse bursts is need , and probably need to include correction of the batse selection effect and to study short grbs with high time resolution tte data . wy appreciate various assistances by dr . r. s. mallozzi at msfc / uah .max_lengthrequest_suffix","the duration of gamma - ray bursts has been found to be bimodally distributed , with two distinct groups of short and long bursts . further analysis of the average pulse width of 1186 batse grbs has shown that the distribution is also bimodal , with a separation around 2 seconds . the long - pulse bursts have longer average pulse widths than the short - pulse bursts , and the dim long - pulse bursts have longer average pulse widths than the bright long - pulse bursts .","we have investigated the bimodal distribution of the duration of batse gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by analyzing light curves of 64 ms time resolution . 
 we define the average pulse width of grbs from the auto - correlation function of grb profiles . 
 the distribution of the average pulse width of grbs is bimodal , suggesting that grbs are composed of long - pulse grbs and short - pulse grbs . 
 the average pulse width of long - pulse grbs appears correlated with the peak flux , consistent with the time dilation effect anticipated from the cosmological origin of grbs . 
 however , the correlation between the average pulse width and the peak flux for the short - pulse grbs does nt show such a tendency , which needs further study with higher time resolution data .

SUMMARY:the period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation for cepheid variables is important in modern astrophysics . in this work 
 , we present the multi - band p - l relations derived from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cepheids , based on the latest release of ogle - iii catalogs . 
 in addition to the @xmath0 band mean magnitudes adopted from ogle - iii catalogs , we also cross - matched the lmc and smc cepheids to the 2mass point source catalogs and publicly available _ spitzer _ catalogs from sage program . 
 mean magnitudes for these cepheids were corrected for extinction using available extinction maps . 
 when comparing the p - l slopes , we found that the p - l slopes in these two galaxies are consistent with each others within @xmath1 level .

TEXT: the quasar j1819 + 3845 is , at radio wavelengths , the most extremely variable extragalactic source known ( dennett - thorpe & de bruyn , 2000 apjl 529 65 ) . at the beginning of 1999 it showed peak to peak variations of more than 600% at 5ghz , with just an hour between the minima . intrinsic variations of this rapidity would require not only absurd brightness temperatures , but a source which would be small enough to scintillate due to the galactic interstellar medium . we therefore consider refractive scintillations as the only cause of the hourly variations and concluded that : +   @xmath0 the scattering occurs in a nearby ( @xmath125pc ) screen +   @xmath0 @xmath255% of the flux density at 5ghz must be contained within a diameter of 30microarcseconds : or 5 light - months at the source redshift ( @xmath3=0.53 ) . +   @xmath0 if the scintillations are due to one component , the brightness temperature t@xmath4=510@xmath5k + this high t@xmath4 combined with a spectral peak @xmath1 100ghz , requires that the source is a transient phenomenon ( @xmath6 5 months ) ; has an exotic emission process ; or has doppler factors of @xmath115 and a continuous energy input . we conducted a monitoring campaign with the wsrt to address the velocity of the scattering plasma ( a critical unknown in the application of the scintillation theory ) , the longevity of the source and the source structure . from the monitoring campaign we found that : + @xmath0 the source continued to scintillate throughout the 14 month observing period . + @xmath0 there is a yearly variation in the timescale of the modulations over this period ; with the fastest variations around february , and the slowest in august . the variations in august are around an order of magnitude slower than those in february . + @xmath0 there is no indication for a change in the strength of the modulations . + these results most easily explained as due to a seasonal change in the relative velocity of the earth and the scattering plasma . this changes the speed at which we move through the projected scintillation pattern . as j1819 + 3845 is very close to the ecliptic pole , there is very little change in the timescale of the modulations due to the earth s motion . we conclude , from fits to the observed timescale ( measured in several different manners ) , that _ the scattering plasma has a velocity @xmath1 25 kms@xmath7 w.r.t . the lsr_. this velocity is in the opposite sense expected due to differential galactic rotation , and further strengthens the notion that the _ scattering occurs predominantly in a discrete structure _ , not throughout the ism . the scintillations from a finite source are weighted towards the medium where the refractive scale ( medium dependent ) , fresnel size ( distance dependent ) and source size are matched . thus quasars ( unlike pulsars ) will be more affected by nearby scattering material . we note that the character of the modulations appears different around may ( smaller , faster variations accompanied with larger excursions ) than at other times of the year ( where the light curves seem smoother ) . furthermore , the period of slow modulations , which extends for almost 6 months , is longer than expected if the change in timescale is solely due to the peculair velocity of the plasma . work is underway to investigate that , in addition to the peculiar velocity of the plasma , there may be additional affects due to source elongation , anisotropic turbulence or contributions from other scattering media ( including the extended galactic ism ) . we have now measured the effective velocity of the scattering medium , and have therefore eliminated a previous unknown in our calculation . assuming that all the flux density in the ` scintillating component ' ( 75mjy at 5ghz ) is in a single component , we have a firm limit t@xmath8510@xmath5k . @xmath0 there is evidence for source structure . as the modulations do not reach 100% at any frequency , the source must have a component which is larger than the scattering zone , or @xmath2 30@xmath9arcsecs at 5ghz . furthermore , there is evidence for substructure in the source , on scales @xmath1 the scattering zone , from the persistent asymmetries in the lightcurves . variations in polarised flux also support multiple scintillating components . @xmath0doppler factors @xmath10 15 would allow for the compton losses which limit the intrinsic t@xmath4 . ( if @xmath11 does not greatly exceed this , the source should be compton limited and therefore a copious x - ray emitter . ) even so , the spectral peak @xmath1 100ghz means that these electrons would lose their energy in a matter of weeks . @xmath0the source shows intrinsic variations in polarisation over a period of months , but at centimeter wavelengths , the intrinsic luminosity of the source has been remarkably constant . at most it has shown a 20% increase .
SUMMARY:we present new wsrt observations of the micro - arcsecond quasar j1819 + 3845 . 
 all short term variations are attributed to interstellar scintillation of a source which is at most 30 micro - arcseconds in diameter . 
 the timescale of the modulations changes over the year , which we interpret as due to a peculiar velocity of the scattering medium . 
 the scintillation behaviour can be used to determine sub - structure in the source .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: distributed word representations have enjoyed success in several nlp tasks @xcite . more recently , the use of distributed representations have been extended to model concepts beyond the word level , such as sentences , phrases and paragraphs @xcite , entities and relationships @xcite and embeddings of semantic categories @xcite .    in this paper we propose a general framework for learning distributed representations of attributes : characteristics of text whose representations can be jointly learned with word embeddings . the use of the word attribute in this context is general . table @xmath0 illustrates several of the experiments we perform along with the corresponding notion of attribute . for example , an attribute can represent an indicator of the current sentence or language being processed . this allows us to learn sentence and language vectors , similar to the proposed model of @xcite . attributes can also correspond to side information , or metadata associated with text . for instance , a collection of blogs may come with information about the age , gender or industry of the author . this allows us to learn vectors that can capture similarities across metadata based on the associated body of text . the goal of this work is to show our notion of attribute vectors can achieve strong performance on a wide variety of nlp related tasks .    to capture these kinds of interactions between attributes and text , we propose the use of a third - order model where attribute vectors act as gating units to a word embedding tensor . that is , words are represented as a tensor consisting of several prototype vectors . given an attribute vector , a word embedding matrix can be computed as a linear combination of word prototypes weighted by the attribute representation . during training , attribute vectors reside in a separate lookup table which can be jointly learned along with word features and the model parameters . this type of three - way interaction can be embedded into a neural language model , where the three - way interaction consists of the previous context , the attribute and the score ( or distribution ) of the next word after the context .    using a word embedding tensor gives rise to the notion of conditional word similarity . more specifically , the neighbours of word embeddings can change depending on which attribute is being conditioned on . for example , the word ` joy ' when conditioned on an author with the industry attribute ` religion ' appears near ` rapture ' and ` god ' but near ` delight ' and ` comfort ' when conditioned on an author with the industry attribute ` science ' . another way of thinking of our model would be the language analogue of @xcite . they used a factored conditional restricted boltzmann machine for modelling motion style defined by real or continuous valued style variables . when our factorization is embedded into a neural language model , it allows us to generate text conditioned on different attributes in the same manner as @xcite could generate motions from different styles . as we show in our experiments , if attributes are represented by different books , samples generated from the model learn to capture associated writing styles from the author . multiplicative interactions have also been previously incorporated into neural language models . @xcite introduced a multiplicative model where images are used for gating word representations . our framework can be seen as a generalization of @xcite and in the context of their work an attribute would correspond to a fixed representation of an image . @xcite introduced a multiplicative recurrent neural network for generating text at the character level . in their model , the character at the current timestep is used to gate the network s recurrent matrix . this led to a substantial improvement in the ability to generate text at the character level as opposed to a non - multiplicative recurrent network .
SUMMARY:in this paper we propose a general framework for learning distributed representations of attributes : characteristics of text whose representations can be jointly learned with word embeddings . 
 attributes can correspond to document indicators ( to learn sentence vectors ) , language indicators ( to learn distributed language representations ) , meta - data and side information ( such as the age , gender and industry of a blogger ) or representations of authors . 
 we describe a third - order model where word context and attribute vectors interact multiplicatively to predict the next word in a sequence . 
 this leads to the notion of conditional word similarity : how meanings of words change when conditioned on different attributes . 
 we perform several experimental tasks including sentiment classification , cross - lingual document classification , and blog authorship attribution . 
 we also qualitatively evaluate conditional word neighbours and attribute - conditioned text generation .

TEXT: we report on simultaneous multifrequency observations of the prominent virgo blazars 3c  273 and 3c  279 during cgro cycle 8 . because both blazars are known  sources , which have been detected by the cgro experiments several times before , we proposed for simultaneous cgro ( osse , comptel ) and rxte high - energy observations . the prime goal was to simultaneously measure their high - energy spectra from about 2.5  kev to 30  mev . because of the shortage of spark chamber gas , the egret experiment is hardly available anymore and therefore was not requested in the proposals . after the proposed simultaneous high - energy observations were approved and scheduled , additional simultaneous observations were performed from ground - based observers extending the energy range of the campaigns to lower energies .    in this paper we report first observational results of the campaigns with emphasis on the x- and  part . in particular we present the measured x- to  spectra of both sources . the multifrequency observations were carried out between 1999 january 5 and february 2 . the observational strategy was that both blazars are within the comptel field - of - view for the whole 4 weeks reaching the optimal sensitivity for the  observations , and osse observes simultaneously each source for 2 weeks . within these two - week osse periods , three rxte pointings were scheduled for each source covering simultaneously the x- and hard x - ray part of the spectrum and providing information on the x - ray variability . to supplement these high - energy observations both sources were simultaneously observed in different optical and radio bands . on 1999 january 15 the optical flux of 3c  279 reached a high level which  after some discussion  triggered target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations of this source . this resulted in a switch - on of egret which led to egret observations of both quasars during roughly the second half of the campaigns . because of the 3c  279 too , the osse 3c  273 observation was stopped after one week , and osse observed 3c  279 again . these egret and osse too observations of 3c  279 are property of a different cgro proposal and therefore their results are not reported here . the detailed high - energy observational log is given in table  [ tab1 ] .    . summary of the satellite observations of both virgo blazars during the campaigns in 1999 . the observation periods as well as the coverage in energy are given . [ cols=""<,^,^,^ "" , ] 3c  273 is significantly detected in all observed low - energy ( radio , optical ) bands . at high energies the quasar is significantly detected in x- and hard x - rays by rxte from about 2.5 to @xmath0100  kev , showing a power - law spectrum with a photon index ( e@xmath1 ) @xmath2 of 1.6 . osse detects the source in the one - week observation at a significance level of @xmath05 . therefore its spectrum had to be rebinned severely to reach two significant spectral points . comptel detects the blazar in the sum of the 4-week observation at the @xmath05  level . however , despite the comptel detection at mev - energies , egret  covering only half of the comptel observation time  does not detect 3c  273 at energies above 100  mev . the combined  more or less simultaneous  high - energy spectrum of 3c  273 is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . the well - known bending ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) at mev - energies is visible . the most surprising result however , is the non - detection by egret at high - energy , despite the comptel detection at mev - energies . this requires a strong spectral turnover between 30 and 100  mev , and might hint at different generation mechanisms for the mev and @xmath3100  mev photon populations . 3c  279 is significantly detected at the radio and optical bands , showing strong time variability and flaring activity in the optical . at x - rays the blazar is significantly observed up to 20  kev by the rxte / pca , and is detected in hard x - rays between 20 and 50  kev by rxte / hexte with a significance of about 5 . the rxte / pca spectrum is well fitted by a single power - law model with an index @xmath2 of 1.6 . at higher energies the detection significances become marginal . osse found 3-evidence for the source only at their lower energies ( near 100  kev ) , and comptel  also at the 3  level  only at their upper energies . at energies above 100 mev egret has significantly detected 3c  279 ( [ 3 ] ) , however these data are not reported here . the measured x- to  spectrum of 3c  279 is given in figure  [ fig2 ] . it shows that 3c  279 was observed in a bright  state . the flux at the comptel upper energies is at the same level as measured during the two previous  high states in 1991 and 1996 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) . the spectral power - law shape measured from @xmath02.5 to 20  kev can  according to the current state of analysis  be extrapolated up to 30  mev without any obvious breaks or bendings . this suggests that this part of the spectrum , which is considered to be non - thermal inverse - compton radiation , is emitted by a single emission component or mechanism .
SUMMARY:we report first observational results of multifrequency campaigns on the prominent virgo blazars 3c  273 and 3c  279 which were carried out in january and february 1999 . both blazars are detected from radio to  energies . 
 we present the measured x- to  spectra of both sources , and for 3c  279 we compare the 1999 broad - band ( radio to ) spectrum to measured previous ones .

TEXT: the motion of point vortices ( pvs ) in a periodic box has been studied numerically in @xcite . the @xmath2 and @xmath1 functions , which are familiar in the field of spatial ecology , are introduced in order to quantitate clustering of pvs . periodic boundary conditions guarantee spatial homogeneity and we need not to include the edge corrections in the @xmath2 function .    in this report , the monte carlo simulation is performed for 100 identical pvs in order to obtain the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the hamiltonian . @xcite showed the pdf for two types of positive and negative pvs and the clustered state of the negative temperature . figure 1 shows the histogram of the hamiltonian for @xmath0 identical pvs @xmath3 + \omega |z_i - z_j|^2/2\ } , \label{eq1}\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the complex position of the pv , @xmath5 denotes the real part , @xmath6 is the weierstrass sigma function parametrized by two numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the ensemble number is @xmath11 . the @xmath12 term denotes a rigid rotation centered at each pv . similarly to @xcite , the distribution with decaying tails is obtained . the figures 2 - 4 and 5 - 7 show the spatial distribution of pvs and the @xmath1 functions for the minimum , median and maximum of the hamiltonian , respectively . the @xmath1 and @xmath2 functions are defined by @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the area , and @xmath17 is the step function . for complete spatial randomness ( csr ) , we have @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the positive ( negative ) values of @xmath1 imply clustering ( uniform spacing ) . the right - side tail in figure 1 corresponds to clustering of pvs , the positive value of @xmath1 , and the state of the onsager s negative temperature . the left - side tail in figure 1 shows uniform spacing of pvs , the negative value of @xmath1 , and the positive temperature . figure 6 shows an oscillatory behavior of the @xmath1 function for the median of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is close to the peak of the histogram ( @xmath22 ) . since there is a minimum in the hamiltonian for each pair of @xmath23 , the total hamiltonian @xmath20 is also lower bounded . however , we have no upper bound for @xmath20 since @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in general , it is difficult to judge whether the point distribution is clustered , completely spatially random , or uniformly spaced . the @xmath1 function is found to be useful for the present purpose . the numerical simulation of 100 pvs with various conditions has been done in @xcite . one of the typical behaviors observed in the case of positive and negative pvs with the same strength is the scattering and recoupling of the linearly moving pair of pvs . a gradient method for detecting stable stationary configurations of pvs , which corresponds to the system of point sources with a uniform sink , has been found by the author and will be reported elsewhere .
SUMMARY:the monte carlo simulation of @xmath0 point vortices with square periodic boundary conditions is performed where @xmath0 is order of 100 . 
 the clustering property is examined by computing the @xmath1 function familiar in the field of spatial ecology . 
 the case of a positive value of @xmath1 corresponds to the state of clustering and the onsager s negative temperature .

 peer social networks appear to be mainly composed of pure resource providers that guarantee high resource availability and reliability of p2p systems . 
 the major peers that both provide and request resources are only a small fraction . 
 the connectivity between peers , including undirected , directed ( out and in ) and weighted connections , is scale - free and the social networks of all peers and major peers are small world networks . 
 the analysis also confirms that peer social networks show in general disassortative correlations , except that active providers are connected between each other and by active requesters . 
 the study presented in this paper gives a better understanding of peer relationships in resource sharing , which may help a better design of future p2p networks and open the path to the study of transport processes on top of real p2p topologies .

TEXT: the concept of intracluster starlight ( icl ) , or stars between the galaxies in galaxy clusters is not a new one : it was first proposed over 50 years ago ( zwicky 1951 ) . however , progress in studying icl has been slow due to its low surface brightness , which is less than 1% of the brightness of the night sky . this is unfortunate , because icl is a powerful probe of the evolution of galaxies in clusters ( dressler 1984 ) , and of cluster evolution overall . it is also an important part of the ejection of matter out of galaxies discussed at this conference . we have undertaken a deep imaging survey of galaxy clusters , intended to quantify the properties of icl as a function of environment , and overall galaxy cluster properties . from our deep imaging , with careful attention to systematic errors ( morrison , boroson , & harding 1994 ) , we are able to measure the icl to faint surface brightnesses many magnitudes below that of the night sky ( @xmath0 @xmath1 2628 ) . in tandem with the observations , we are constructing numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in a cosmological context , similar to those of dubinski ( 1998 ) . here we summarize some recent results : previous results can be found in feldmeier ( 2002 ) . models of intracluster star production predict that intracluster light may not always be in a smooth , elliptically symmetric , component but instead can be in tidal tails and arcs ( moore 1996 ; napolitano 2003 ) . in our deep imaging survey , we have found intracluster tidal debris in almost every cluster we have surveyed ( see figure  1 for one of the most striking examples ) . however , at this time , we have detected more plume - like structures than the long arcs originally predicted by the models . since only half of the survey has been completely reduced , the significance of this result is unclear . determining the amount of icl from our imaging observations is non - trivial because it is difficult to separate the outer edges of galaxies from the underlying background icl . to make a model - independent estimate of icl fraction in the clusters observed , we used an isophotal cutoff . the exact value of the cutoff is problematic , so we have adopted a range of values to set reasonable limits . we find that for the clusters surveyed thus far , the amount of icl is 1020% , including a correction for the edges of galaxies still unmasked . this is similar to the amount of intracluster light found in the nearby virgo and fornax clusters ( see arnaboldi , this volume ) . dressler , a. 1984 , , 22 , 185 dubinski , j. 1998 , , 502 , 141 feldmeier , j.  j. , 2002 , , 575 , 779 morrison , h. l. , boroson , t. a. & harding p. , 1994 , , 108 , 1191 napolitano , n.r . , 2003 , , 594 , 172 zwicky , f. 1951 , , 63 , 61

TEXT: results of the precision measurements of kaonic hydrogen atoms by the siddharta collaboration @xcite form already part of the data - base used by ikeda , hyodo and weise ( ihw ) in constructing the antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes near threshold @xcite . studies of kaonic atoms using potentials built on sub - threshold in - medium antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes @xcite clearly indicate that multinucleon processes contribute significantly to the observed strong - interaction level shifts and widths . in particular it was shown @xcite using the ihw amplitudes that analysing so - called ` lower ' and ` upper ' levels in the same atom could separate one - nucleon ( 1n ) absorption from multinucleon ( mn ) processes . this property is the result of the very different radial dependences of the 1n and 2n terms of the potential , as demonstrated for ni and pb in table [ tab : radii ] . it is seen that in both examples the rms radius of the 1n real term is larger than that for the mn real term by 0.95 fm and that for the imaginary part the difference is 1.2 to 1.3 fm .    with the one - nucleon amplitudes firmly based on the siddharta experiment and its subsequent analyses , there is now a possibility to gain information on multinucleon processes of antikaons in nuclei . this calls for reduced uncertainties in experimental results , particularly for the upper level widths . .rms radii of various terms of the k@xmath1-nucleus potential ( in fm ) . r@xmath2 is the rms radius of the nucleus .

( [ eq : width ] ) . that causes the cascade process to terminate within one or two levels when the nuclear absorption dominates . direct measurements of strong interaction widths of two levels require the measurement of two successive x - ray transitions . the present results suggest that there could only be a handful of elements where the required conditions are met and it raises the question of whether experiments on a few elements could match the present data base which includes 24 different species of kaonic atoms . the question of whether a partial set of data for kaonic atoms could provide similar information to what is obtained from the full data was discussed already in @xcite , showing that indeed it was possible . here we have compared the results of global fits to the present - day full data set with results of similar fits to part of the data . selecting a partial set of the full data , namely si , s , ni , cd , sn , yb and ta that represent the four groups in table [ tab : yields ] , we obtain parameter values and uncertainties very close to what is found in fits to the full data . this suggests that a set of about six targets , carefully selected , will be equivalent to the full data base , particularly if the quality of the data is at least as good as that of the old data . finally , test calculations show that uncertainties of parameters of the best - fit potentials indeed go down by close to 50% if upper level widths replace relative yields in the data . we conclude that new kaonic atom experiments on several carefully selected targets using state - of - the - art microcalorimetric spectroscopy could provide widths of lower and upper levels in the same atom which , in turn , could enhance our understanding of multinucleon absorption of antikaons in the nuclear medium . discussions with a.  gal and correspondence with w.b . doriese and j.n . ullom are gratefully acknowledged . this work was supported by the eu initiative fp7 , hadronphysics3 , under the sphere and leannis cooperation programs , by jsps kakenhi grant number 25105514 and by incentive research grant from riken .
SUMMARY:recent studies of strong interaction effects in kaonic atoms suggest that analysing so - called ` lower ' and ` upper ' levels in the same atom could separate one - nucleon absorption from multinucleon processes . 
 the present work examines the feasibility of direct measurements of upper level widths in addition to lower level widths in future experiments , using superconducting microcalorimeter detectors . 
 about ten elements are identified as possible candidates for such experiments , all of medium - weight and heavy nuclei . 
 new experiments focused on achieving good accuracy for widths of such pairs of levels could contribute significantly to our knowledge of the @xmath0-nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: numerical relativity has the potential to make indispensable contributions to our understanding of hydrodynamic compact object phenomena , such as neutron star - neutron star ( nsns ) binary merger , black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binary merger , and stellar core collapse . in such systems , both the spacetime metric and the fluid are dynamical , and they are strongly coupled . the most common approach to numerically solving the coupled einstein - hydrodynamics equations is by finite differencing . finite difference ( fd ) techniques have been successfully used to simulate nsns binaries , stellar collapse , and other interesting phenomena . fd algorithms usually converge to the exact solution as some power of the grid spacing . in addition , techniques have been developed which can evolve fluids with discontinuities stably and accurately . unfortunately , fd codes usually require very large grids in order to obtain accurate results . einstein s equations can also be evolved using pseudospectral ( ps ) methods . for smooth functions , ps methods converge _ exponentially _ to the exact solution as the number of collocation points is increased . this allows ps methods to get accurate results with much smaller grids than those used by fd codes . a ps code for solving the einstein equations has been developed by the cornell - caltech relativity group  @xcite and successfully used to carry out binary black hole inspiral simulations  @xcite which are both the most accurate and computationally cheapest of their kind . there is a difficulty in evolving non - vacuum spactimes spectrally , however . because of the possibility of stellar surfaces and shocks , the evolved variables are not always smooth at all derivatives . in these cases , spectral representations display gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity which converge away only like a power of the number of collocation points , the order of convergence given by the order of the discontinuity . in some cases , the problem can be avoided by placing domain boundaries at discontinuities , but this is not practical for complicated shocks or strongly deformed stellar surfaces . another possibility would be a mixed approach : to evolve the metric fields , which are much smoother , using ps methods and evolve the hydrodynamic fields using shock - capturing fd methods . this would seem to utilize the strongest features of each method . this approach has been used successfully in a conformal gravity code to perform stellar collapse computations  @xcite . here we extend this approach to full gr . we integrate the hydrodynamic equations in conservative form . using piecewise parabolic reconstruction  @xcite together with a high - resolution central scheme  @xcite . we use uniform grids in three or two dimensions ( the latter for axisymmetric systems ) . the vacuum outside the stars is handled by introducing a tenuous `` atmosphere '' , together with a density floor and an internal energy ceiling , in these regions . the einstein equations are evolved in the generalized harmonic system  @xcite . we find that filtering the metric variables is sufficient to stabilize the ps code in the presence of discontinuities . the interpolation from the spectral to the fluid grid would be very expensive if done directly , but we make the process much quicker using a technique introduced by boyd  @xcite . both codes use dual coordinate frames , which allow the grid to dynamically adjust to the motion of the system  @xcite . our finite difference code currently has no adaptive griding capability , but our two - grid approach gives us a few similar advantages . the finite difference grid need only cover the region containing the matter a huge savings in many binary applications . the dual coordinate frame system allows the finite difference grid to move with the stars . also , separate coordinate mappings can be applied to the two grids so that their resolutions can be controlled separately . our fd code has been successfully tested by evolving multi - dimensional shocks . in order to test the full fd plus ps code , we evolve equilibrium polytropes . we choose the domain decomposition of the ps grid to consist of a filled sphere ( a `` ball '' ) centered on the star surrounded by several concentric spherical shells . angular basis functions are spherical harmonics . for radial basis functions , we use chebyshev polynomials on the shells and an appropriate set of functions  @xcite on the ball .    in figure  [ fig ] , we show results for four @xmath0 polytropes . star a is a stable tov star with central density @xmath1 = 0.67 , star b is an unstable tov star with @xmath1 = 1.33 , star c has the same rest mass as star a but rotates uniformly with an angular velocity 80% of the mass shedding limit , and star c is a hypermassive rapidly differentially rotating star evolved by other groups  @xcite . we choose the fd grid spacing so that 30 points cover a stellar radius . ( we find that axisymmetric and 3d runs give similar results for all the models . ) for stars a , b , and c , we choose our ps grids to have two shells , with the inner one containing the stellar surface . we use spherical harmonics up to @xmath2 , and we use 7 , 9 , and 7 radial collocation points in the ball and the two shells , respectively . we find that the error in the ps grid is dominated by the shell containing the stellar surface , and it decreases quadratically with the grid spacing in this shell . we add a 1% pressure depletion to test stability . for star d , we choose the ball with spherical harmonics up to @xmath3 and 18 radial points to cover the whole star . we find that our code can accurately evolve equilibrium stars and distinguish stable from unstable configurations . we have also successfully evolved moving stars using the dual coordinate system to track the star s center of mass . these tests encourage us to think that our code might be able to produce accurate simulations of nsns and bhns binaries . this work was supported in part by a grant from the sherman fairchild foundation , by nsf grants dms-0553677 , phy-0354631 , and nasa grant nng05gg51 g .

SUMMARY:we studied the behaviour of the optical afterglow lightcurves of a sample of 24 gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) with known redshift and published estimates of the optical extinction in the source frame , detected before the swift satellite launch . 
 we found an unexpected clustering of the optical luminosities at 12 hours in the source frame . 
 the distribution of the optical luminosities is narrower than the distribution of x  ray luminosities at the same time . 
 few ( 3 ) bursts stand apart from the main optical distribution , being fainter by a factor of about 15 . 
 we also analysed the optical luminosities of the swift burst with known redshift finding that the luminosity distribution is similar to the pre swift grbs one , even if they have a different mean redshift . 
 these results can suggest the existence of a family of intrinsically optically under 
 luminous dark grbs .

TEXT: luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) are a morphologically and spectroscopically diverse class of galaxies characterized by high luminosity ( m@xmath3  @xmath418.5 ) , blue color ( b@xmath5v@xmath60.6 ) and high surface brightness ( sb@xmath7 21 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) . at z@xmath01 , lcbgs are common , contributing 45% of the total star formation rate density , but they evolve rapidly being ten times rarer by z@xmath00 . as such , it is important to understand the role of lcbgs in galaxy formation and evolution . yet we do not know the basic nature of these galaxies nor their evolutionary fate . they may evolve into dwarf ellipticals @xcite , irregular or low - mass spiral galaxies @xcite , or bulges of grand - design spirals @xcite . in order to discriminate between these possibilities , we have begun a multi - wavelength study of the rare , local ( d@xmath9200  mpc ) lcbgs . our sample was selected from the sloan digital sky survey to match the rest - frame optical properties as lcbgs observed at z@xmath01 . a key component of this study is the measurement of the hi flux and linewidths , allowing determinations of gas content , dynamical masses , and gas depletion timescales . such measurements constrain the evolutionary possibilities for this class of galaxies . background and preliminary results have been previously reported by @xcite ; in this proceedings we present the first results from our expanded study of 142 lcbgs . our single - dish hi data come from a number of sources : 57 lcbgs were observed with arecibo , the green bank telescope ( gbt ) , or nanay , down to a 5@xmath10  m@xmath1 detection limit of 2.5@xmath1110@xmath12m@xmath13 . data on the remaining 85 galaxies come from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the gbt hi survey . we reanalyzed all of the spectra ; only two galaxies were marginal detections and two were undetected . our survey found that local lcbgs have a diverse range of hi properties , but that they are generally gas - rich with m@xmath14 . they have m@xmath2 within r@xmath15 of 10@xmath16 . these properties , as well as their mass - to - light and m@xmath1/m@xmath2 , are similar to those of late - type spiral galaxies @xcite . lcbgs have specific star formation rates ( sfr / m@xmath2 ) similar to hii galaxies , and gas depletion timescales @xmath172  gyr for the majority of the population . the sizes and hi linewidths of local lcbgs , which should not evolve dramatically , suggest that they will become massive dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars , or late - type spiral galaxies . if the z@xmath01 lcbgs have similar gas properties , then we can infer that those lcbgs will follow similarly diverse evolutionary paths . this work confirms the results of @xcite with a much larger sample . we have begun a program of mapping a number of these galaxies in hi to search for gas - rich companions , signatures of outflows and recent interactions , as well as to obtain resolved measurements of their rotation curves to derive their dynamical masses . finally , we are obtaining additional data ranging from the radio to the x - ray regime , to further understand the nature of these galaxies .
SUMMARY:luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) are common at z@xmath01 , contributing significantly to the total star formation rate density . by z@xmath00 , they are a factor of ten rarer . while we know 
 that lcbgs evolve rapidly , we do not know what drives their evolution nor into what types of galaxies they evolve . 
 we present the results of a single - dish hi survey of local lcbgs undertaken to address these questions . 
 our results indicate that lcbgs have m@xmath1 and m@xmath2 consistent with low - mass spirals , but typically exhaust their gas reservoirs in less than 2 gyr . 
 overall , the properties of lcbgs are consistent with them evolving into high - mass dwarf elliptical or dwarf irregular galaxies or low - mass , late - type spiral galaxies .

TEXT: we take the observation that two of the three giant flares from the sgrs were preceded by a precursor that was similar in energy ( @xmath0 ) to a typical short sgr burst ( ibrahim et al . 2001 ; hurley et al . 2005 ) as a hint that the precursor `` lights the fuse '' for the giant flare . the natural timescale for this fuse is the alfvn time of the inner magnetosphere , which for exceptionally low values of the plasma beta parameter is very small ; @xmath1s . although this is close to the rise time of the flare , this timescale is up to six orders of magnitude shorter than the delay between the precursor and the flare . of course , the symmetries of the magnetic field coupled to the plasma prevent the quasi - steady - state configuration to change this quickly unless the gradient of the magnetic field are large . so , the questions are how does the field develop large gradients and can this happen on the timescale of the delay between the precursors and the giant flares .    figure  [ fig : nsfig ] outlines a scenario where the initial sgr flare which is associated with a crustal shift injects a twist in the magnetosphere ( thompson & duncan 1995 ) . this causes the external magnetic field lines to form a configuration allowing the formation of a current sheet where the field lines can reconnect and release a large amount of magnetic energy ( see for e.g. lyutikov 2006 ) . this reconnection will proceed slowly over a resistive timescale . the standard picture for this process is the sweet - parker layer denoted in figure  [ fig : nsfig ] and placed into focus in the left panel of figure  [ fig : current_layers ] . we assume that the plasma is incompressible and that the magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy . combining these assumptions with the geometry then yields a relationship between the alfvnic mach number of the reconnecting flow and the resistivity through the lundquist number , @xmath2 because the spitzer resistivity of the collisionless plasma at temperatures @xmath3 is small , this mach number is small , and the reconnection timescale is large unless some sort of anomalous resistivity is present . we will use the super - hot turbulent current layer ( shtcl ) model to introduce a source of anomalous resistivity ( somov 2006 ) . again making the same assumptions as with the sweet - parker layer but with the modified geometry of the right panel of figure  [ fig : current_layers ] , we obtain the reconnection velocity of @xmath4 which now depends on geometric considerations rather than the spitzer resistivity of the plasma . what length scales do we have ? from biggest to smallest , we have the layer width ( @xmath5 ) , the layer funnel width ( @xmath6 ) , the layer thickness ( @xmath7 ) , the proton cyclotron radius , and the electron cyclotron radius . cassak et al . ( 2006 ) show that the sweet - parker layer can be thinned down to proton cyclotron lengthscale by convecting strong fields into the current layer . we find the critical field strength for this to occur @xmath8 . with the presence of baryons the thinned current layer undergoes hall reconnection which proceeds on an alfvnic timescale , hundreds of microseconds typically . thus , the delay between the precursor to the flare is the timescale to thin from the initial reconnection region ( this determines the total energy of the flare ) to the proton cyclotron radius . the thin shtcl provides anomalous resistivity that allows the current layer to thin on a timescale comparable to the delay for the december 27 event @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field shear length , @xmath11 is the length of the current sheet , @xmath12 we have used the data for the december 27 event . the august 27 flare had a short and weak precursor , yielding about one percent of the baryons . furthermore , the flare was weaker too , requiring a smaller reconnection region . we get @xmath13 similar to the delay for the august 27 event . future giant flares from sgrs will improve our understanding of such correlations as well as the mechanism for the triggering of giant flares from soft - gamma repeaters . cassak p. a. , drake j. f. , shay m. a. , 2006 , apjl , 644 , l145 + gill r. , heyl j. s. , 2010 , mnras , 407 , 1926 + hurley k. , et al . , 2005 , nature , 434 , 1098 + ibrahim a. i. , et al . , 2001 , apj , 558 , 237 + lyutikov m. , 2006 , mnras , 367 , 1594 + somov , b. , 2006 , _ plasma astrophysics , part ii : reconnection and flares _ , astrophysics and space science library ( assl ) , vol . 341 . dordrecht : springer + thompson c. , duncan r. c. , 1995 , mnras , 275 , 255
SUMMARY:we examine an external trigger mechanism that gives rise to the intense soft gamma - ray repeater ( sgr ) giant flares . out of the three giant flares , 
 two showcased the existence of a precursor , which we show to have had initiated the main flare . 
 we develop a reconnection model based on the hypothesis that shearing motion of the footpoints causes the materialization of a sweet - parker current layer in the magnetosphere . 
 the thinning of this macroscopic layer due to the development of an embedded super - hot turbulent current layer switches on the impulsive hall reconnection , which powers the giant flare . 
 we show that the thinning time is on the order of the pre - flare quiescent time .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the fundamental properties of the strong interactions in the non - perturbative range are closely related to the excitation spectrum of nucleons , which is not fully understood yet and therefore represents an intensively discussed topic . the apparently poor match @xcite between the experimental database for excited nucleon states and model predictions based on quantum chromodynamics ` inspired ' quark models has motivated huge efforts in experimental and theoretical development . to overcome the limitations in the available database , which was dominated by the results from pion scattering on nucleons and thus biased against nucleon resonances with small couplings to @xmath7 , was the primery target . huge advances in accelerator and detector technology allow for photoproduction of mesons , which thus has become a prime tool in this research . sequential decays involving intermediate excited states are playing an essential role in these processes and are especially important for resonances from the third resonance region and above , where the cross sections from many single - meson channels are decreasing . these types of reactions have attracted much interest in recent years and thus the photoproduction of pseudoscalar meson pairs , mostly @xmath8 but also @xmath9 , has been studied in detail experimentally ( see refs . @xcite@xmath10@xcite for recent results ) . the measurement of pion pairs with different charge combinations and also measurements of their production off both nucleons is mandatory for an isospin decomposition of the reaction , helping to identify contributions from @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances . at least 23 independent variables would have to be measured in order to fix amplitudes and phases in the description of photoproduction of pseudo - scalar meson pairs @xcite and thus a complete measurement appears unrealistic . but already the measurement of at least some polarization observables can provide valuable constraints for the reaction models , since these observables are often very sensitive to small details in the reaction mechanisms . the experiments were performed at the tagged photon facility at the mainz microtron accelerator mami@xcite . detailed information about the different components of the detector setup and analysis techniques can be found in refs . @xcite@xmath13@xcite@xmath10@xcite . the charged pions and the photons from the @xmath14 decay were detected in coincidence with the recoil nucleons . standard analysis steps , like cuts on the invariant mass m(@xmath15 ) , missing mass @xmath16 and coplanarity @xmath17 ( azimuthal angular difference between the three - momenta of the two - pion system and the recoil nucleon ) , led to a very clean signal extraction , see fig . [ fig : ana ] . the beam - helicity asymmetry is defined as in refs . @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the differential cross sections for each of the two photon helicity states . a comparison of our free proton data to previously measured beam - helicity asymmetries @xcite showed a good agreement . in order to eliminate effects from the nuclear fermi motion in the quasi - free data an analysis was performed that used the invariant mass @xmath20 of the final state extracted from the four - momenta of the mesons and the recoil nucleons ( rather than being approximated from the incident photon energy neglecting the fermi momenta ) . the quasi - free proton results obtained this way are in good agreement with the free proton results . the agreement between the free and quasi - free proton data demonstrates that the kinematic reconstruction of the final state eliminates effects from nuclear fermi motion and that no other nuclear effects like final state interactions are important . due to its symmetry properties , @xmath21 can be expanded in a sine series ( @xmath22 ) which can be fitted to the data . this allows for a more compact presentation of the results . in fig . [ fig : i ] the energy dependence of the parameters @xmath23 for @xmath244 ( higher orders were not significant ) are shown for free and quasi - free data and all four channels . the model calculations show a good agreement for @xmath25 of the neutral channel , whereas the agreement is less good for @xmath26 . for the mixed - charge asymmetries the agreement is rather poor and it seems that the reaction mechanisms are still not understood very well . the present data will certainly constrain future model analyses of this reactions .
SUMMARY:beam - helicity asymmetries and mass - differential cross sections have been measured at the mami accelerator in mainz for the photoproduction of neutral and mixed - charge pion pairs in the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 off free protons and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 off quasi - free nucleons bound in the deuteron for incident photon energies up to 1.4 gev . 
 circularly polarized photons were produced in bremsstrahlung processes of longitudinally polarized electrons and tagged with the glasgow - mainz magnetic spectrometer . 
 the decay products ( photons , protons , neutrons , and charged pions ) were detected in the @xmath6 electromagnetic calorimeter composed of the crystal ball and taps detectors . 
 using a full kinematic reconstruction of the final state , excellent agreement was found between the results for free and quasi - free protons , indicating that the quasi - free neutron results are also a close approximation of the free - neutron results . 
 comparisons of the results to predictions from model calculations suggest that especially the reaction mechanisms in the production of the mixed - charge final states are still not well understood , in particular at low incident photon energies in the second nucleon resonance region .

TEXT: the spectral lines of rare - earth elements are present in solar as well as in stellar spectra ( see e.g. grevesse & blanquet 1969 , molnar 1972 , adelman 1987 , mathys & cowley 1992 , sadakane 1993 , bidelman et al . 1995 , cowley et al . 1996 , etc . ) . principally , these lines originate in layers of stellar atmospheres with higher electron density ( photosphere or subphotosphere ) . consequently , electron - impact broadening mechanism can be important , especially for hot ( a and b ) stars as well as for white dwarfs . so , it is important to have a set of electron - impact broadening data for the lines of ionized rare - earth elements . for some transitions of laii and laiii we have calculated stark widths ( popovi & dimitrijevi 1997 ) by using the modified semiempirical approach ( dimitrijevi & konjevi 1980 , popovi & dimitrijevi 1996a , b ) . here we present our plans and specify the number of lines for which we may calculate electron - impact broadening parameters with a satisfying accuracy and discuss the difficulties which may appear in the calculation . due to the lack of known energy levels as well as of reliable transition probabilities for rare - earth elements , the approximate methods are adequate for stark broadening calculations . consequently the modified semiempirical approach will be applied . this method was developed by dimitrijevi & konjevi(1980 ) . for the case of ions with complex spectra the improvement was done by popovi & dimitrijevi ( 1996a , b ) . also , as regards lines for which it is not possible to apply this method , we will use the simplified modified semiempirical formula ( smse ) given by dimitrijevi & konjevi ( 1987 ) . for the lines which are very important for astrophysical purposes and for which , due to the lack of atomic data , it is not possible to use even the smse method , we will estimate stark broadening parameters on the basis of regularities and systematic trends ( rst , dimitrijevi & popovi 1989 ) .    . list of the ions for which we are going to calculate the electron - impact broadening parameters . the number of transitions given in the table could be calculated using the modified - semiempirical ( mse ) and simplified modified - semiempirical ( smse ) methods , the @xmath0 indicates that the data can be provided for several other transitions by using regularities and systematic trends ( rst ) for astrophysically very important lines . key to the columns : i , iv  ion , ii , v  number of transition for which we can calculate the stark broadening parameters , iii , vi  method which we are going to use . [ cols=""<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]     moreover , due to the very complex spectra of ionized rare - earth elements we have to improve the existing software developed by us ( popovi 1994 ) . it means that calculations within intercoupling approximation have to be performed . for example in the spectra of ceiii , the @xmath1 levels are well described by @xmath2 coupling approximation , while @xmath3 levels , which are perturbed by @xmath1 ones , are well described by @xmath4 coupling approximation . such interaction between these two levels should be taken into account . also , a numerical experiment about the influence of this effect on calculated parameters should be done . in table 1 we present the ions and number of lines for which we are going to calculate the electron - impact broadening parameters . as one can see from table 1 , there is a very limited number of transitions for which this is possible ( only 51 transitions ) . the list has been made taking into account atomic data given by martin et al . ( 1978 ) , so , this list may be extended after a detailed search through literature and after including the new experimental results .
SUMMARY:in order to provide atomic data needed for astrophysical investigations , a set of electron - impact broadening parameters for ionized rare - earth element lines should be calculated . 
 we are going to calculate the electron - impact broadening parameters for more than 50 transitions of ionized rare - earth elements . taking into account that the spectra of these elements are very complex , for calculation we can use the modified semiempirical approach  mse or simplified mse . 
 also , we can estimate these parameters on the basis of regularities and systematic trends .

SUMMARY:recently , allen et al . measured a tight correlation between the bondi accretion rates and jet powers of the nuclei of nearby x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies . 
 we employ two models of jet powering to understand the above correlation and derive constraints on the spin and accretion rate of the central black holes . 
 the first is the blandford - znajek model , in which the spin energy of the hole is extracted as jet power ; the second model is an hybrid version of the blandford - payne and blandford - znajek processes , in which the outflow is generated in the inner parts of the accretion disk . 
 we assume advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) and account for general relativistic effects . 
 our modelling implies that for typical values of the disk viscosity parameter @xmath0 the tight correlation implies the narrow range of spins @xmath1 and accretion rates @xmath2 . 
 our results provide support for the `` spin paradigm '' scenario and suggest that the central black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly rotating in order to drive radio jets powerful enough to quench the cooling flows .

TEXT: the output parameters of ` nbody6++ ` ( aarseth 1999 ) simulations are mostly theoretical values . to make a direct comparison between n - body simulation data and observations , we combine galev ( galaxy evolutionary synthesis models ; kotulla et al . 2009 ) , a flexible algorithm to combine astrophysical colors in many filters and spectra of stars ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) or sets of stars , with ` nbody6++ ` simulations . in this paper , we present the structure of this new code : galevnb ( galev for n - body simulations ) . adapting subroutines from galev , galevnb can produce spectra spans the range from far - uv at 90@xmath0 to far ir at 160@xmath2 m , with a spectral resolution of 20@xmath0 in the uv - optical and 50 - 100@xmath0 in the near ir range . given a list of requested filters in hst , eso , sdss , 2mass etc . , galevnb convolves the spectra with the filter response functions and applies the chosen zero - points ( vegamag , abmag , and stmag ) to yield absolute magnitudes . galevnb bridges theoretical parameters and their observed values , thus allows us to understand the color and spectra evolution of star clusters , and to determine the initial conditions and parameters of star cluster simulations with a direct comparison to observations . the main program of galevnb is ` galevnb.f90 ` , which parses single snapshot files ( stellar evolution only ) generated by ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` . it uses seven subroutines ( ` startomaginit ` , ` specint_initialize ` , ` reset_weights ` , ` startomag ` , ` add_star ` , ` spec2mag ` , ` spec_output ` ) of galev package to convert effective temperature , stellar luminosity , metallicity , and mass into observational magnitudes and spectra . the functions of these routines are presented in table 1 . the galevnb package contains four folders : 1 ) ` spectral_templates ` , in which locate all the spectral template files from the basel library of model atmospheres ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) ; 2 ) ` standard_filters ` , contains a large set of filter response functions ( fuv , nuv , u , b , v , r , i , j , h , k ) that are used as standard reference filters ; 3 ) ` filter_response_curves ` , includes filter response functions from magnitude systems of hst , eso instruments , 2mass , sdss , johnson , and cousins in separate subfolders . we also provide a choice of user - specify filter response functions . information about the entire set of available filters is included in the file ` filterlist.dat ` . please aware that ` filterlist.dat ` , in which the user specify their own choice of magnitude system by uncommenting the line of chosen filter , must be presented in the same directory as the ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` snapshot files . the content of the file , ` filterlist.dat ` , is presented in table 2 .    to compile galevnb , the user should have c++ and fortran installed . the input file of galevnb should be a sinlge snapshot output from ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` simulations . in case of a file containing all snapshots ( called ` sev.83 ` in ` nbody6++ ` and ` fort.83 ` in ` nbody6 ` ) , we provide the user with a shell script ` generate_snapshots.sh ` in the folder , ` scripts ` , for retrieving single snapshot data out of ` sev.83 ` and ` fort.83 ` . the user can select his / her preferred filters ( maximum 20 ) by uncommenting the row of the corresponding filter in ` filterlist.dat ` , and choose his / her desired magnitude system ( table 2 ) . magnitudes of individual stars and the whole cluster , and spectra of the cluster or chosen stellar types are produced , respectively . cc subroutine & function + ` specint_initialize ` & initialize the stellar spectra + ` reset_weights ` & reset the weight of stellar spectra + ` add_star ` & integrate the flux of all stars in the cluster + ` spec_output ` & output spectra + ` startomaginit ` & initialize the stellar magnitude + ` spec2mag ` & convolve the stellar spectra with the filter response function + ` startomag ` & compute magnitudes for stars +    ccc column & content & i d of zero point + 1 & filter name & + 2 & corresponding path of the filter response function & + 3 & i d of selected zero point ( default value is 1 ) & + 4 & standard zero point in the vega magnitude system & 1 + 5 & standard zero point in the ab magnitude system & 2 + 6 & standard zero point in the st magnitude system & 3 + 7 & optional user - defined zero point & 4 +
SUMMARY:we report on galevnb ( galev for n - body simulations ) , an integrated software solution that provides n - body users direct access to the software package galev ( galaxy evolutionary synthesis models ) . 
 galevnb is developed for the purpose of a direct comparison between n - body simulations and observations . 
 it converts the fundamental stellar properties of n - body simulations , i.e. , stellar mass , temperature , stellar luminosity and metallicity , into observational magnitudes for a variety of filters of widely used instruments / telescopes ( hst , eso , sdss , 2mass ) , and into spectra that span from far - uv ( 90 @xmath0 ) to near - ir ( 160 @xmath1 m ) .

TEXT: we use a pre - computed database of 46800 synthetic flux and polarization spectra for field strengths of 1400 mg and a wide range of effective temperatures to generate synthetic zeeman spectra , which we subject to an automatic optimization scheme with the aim to recover the parameters describing the original magnetic field configuration . we adopt input field geometries which involve the sum of non - aligned dipole and quadrupole components . we also provide for off - centre shifts of the configuration . by adding gaussian noise we create input spectra with and 20 , respectively . = 0.80    off - centred dipole - quadrupole combinations are reliably recovered even for by our code , which can handle up to 12 free parameters but becomes inefficient if higher multipoles are included . the poor convergence is caused by the complexity of the @xmath0-landscape , which develops an increasing number of secondary minima for more complex field geometries ( for a detailed investigation , see euchner et al . , 2002 ) . we find that a given set of phase - resolved zeeman spectra can be reproduced within the noise by quite different formal representations of the field , which , however , all seem to describe rather similar actual field geometries . we are confident , therefore , that observed phase - resolved zeeman spectra can provide quite definite information on the field structure . = 0.85    the magnetic field structure over the surface of accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic binaries becomes accessible to observation only in states of low or switched - off accretion . following the first detection of zeeman lines in the polar eferidani ( @xmath1 = 81 min ) by wheatley & ramsay ( 1998 ) , we obtained phase - resolved flux and circular polarization spectra of this object with fors1 at the eso vlt on 22 nov 2000 . fig.1 shows the spectra collected in four almost equal phase bins after removal of a slight rotational temperature variation . there is no obvious variation of the zeeman structures with phase . fits of inclined multipole field models with the angle @xmath2 between magnetic and rotational axis left free yielded . the lack of phase dependence of the zeeman features further suggests that the tesseral / sectoral multipole components are weak . we fitted the mean flux and polarization spectra , therefore , with an expansion including only the zonal components up to a maximum degree . fig.2 shows the dipole+quadrupole fit , which is substantially better than the pure dipole ( not shown ) . fig.3 depicts the result for the expansion up to . the dipole is replaced by large coefficients for the higher - order multipole components which substantially improve the fit . while the higher - order multipole fit accounts for many of the observed details  all the wiggles in the blue are genuine zeeman features there are still noticeable discrepancies : ( i ) the observed lack of circular polarization around 5700  requires that a larger fraction of the field occurs at negative @xmath3 ( angle between line of sight and field direction ) , and ( ii ) the observed narrow spectral feature at 5120  can be fitted by additional field contributions with @xmath4 between 60 and 100 mg pointing away from the observer , possibly generated by a steeper rise of @xmath4 towards the lower ( unseen ) pole than provided by the model .
SUMMARY:we have developed a new method to derive the magnetic field distribution on the surfaces of rotating magnetic white dwarfs from phase - resolved flux and circular polarization spectra . 
 an optimization code based on an evolutionary strategy is used to fit synthetic zeeman spectra for a variety of model geometries described in the framework of a truncated multipole expansion . 
 we demonstrate that the code allows the reconstruction of relatively complex fields using noise - added synthetic input spectra . as a first application 
 , we analyze flux and circular polarization spectra of the polar eferi in a low state of accretion taken with fors1 at the eso vlt .

TEXT: while it is widely agreed upon that galaxy - galaxy interactions and , in particular , mergers play a crucial role for the growth of supermassive black holes in quasars and also for providing the fuel for quasar activity , there is still dispute whether these black holes are of primordial nature or not . n - body simulations ( e.g. by @xcite ) show that the tidal forces in interacting galaxies can trigger strong gas inflows towards the center of the merger . the mass of this gas is sufficient to build a supermassive bh of @xmath0 and provide enough fuel for quasar activity . on the basis of the @xmath1-viscosity model by @xcite calculations by @xcite show that it takes less than @xmath2a from the merger to form a fully developed quasar even if no primordial supermassive bh was originally present . this model can be tested by comparing the resulting co - moving space density of quasars to those derived from observations ( e.g. @xcite ) . based on results by @xcite we assume an average time delay of @xmath3a between the merger and the peak quasar activity . the individual values of this delay depend , of course , on details like the size ( @xmath4 ) and initial mass ( @xmath5 ) of the disk . estimates of the relevant ( viscous ) timescale show its dependence @xmath6 . this leads to the  at first glance surprising  finding of the faster formation of the more massive black holes . for our present purpose , however , an average value of this delay serves its purpose . for more details of this model , we refer the reader to the contribution by duschl and strittmatter in this volume and in @xcite .    for our purpose it is sufficient to use a  test universe "" comprised of 50 000 galaxies . this test universe is expanding according to an einstein - de sitter - cosmology with a hubble constant of @xmath7 . our galaxies are treated as particles with a finite cross section and a thermal velocity dispersion of @xmath8 . in this framework we compute the merger rate for each simulated time bin ( @xmath9a ) by taking into account two different processes : direct geometrical hits and gravitationally driven mergers . for the first process we assume every galaxy to have a spherical cross section with a radius of 15 kpc . for the second process the cross section radius is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the mass of one galaxy and @xmath12 being the relative velocity between both . we assume a delay between the merger and the onset of the quasar phase of @xmath13a for the geometrical hit and @xmath14a for the gravitationally driven merger . the quasar phase in turn is assumed to last for another @xmath15a .    in our model the universe is treated in very simple manner : as an expanding spherical box . the size of this box is determined by deriving today s matter density from the assumed hubble constant ( @xmath16 ) and then using the friedmann - lematre - equation to calculate the according radius at any given time . we completely neglect structure formation and start our simulation with large galaxies ( @xmath17 ) already in place @xmath18a after the big bang . to account for the formation of galaxies we increase their number over the first @xmath13a of our simulation until the final number of 50 000 is reached ( see fig . [ horst02simul ] for the effect of this procedure ) . a. in panel b ) a constant galaxy formation rate and in panel c ) a gaussian formation rate were used the resulting co - moving space density of quasars is almost exactly the same . ] the comparison between our model results and observational data compiled by @xcite is shown in fig.[horst02obs ] . the quasar density evolution at lower redshifts and the position of the peak at @xmath19 match very well . please note that the x - ray selected sample contains lower luminosity agn in addition to quasars . in this respect it is natural that our results resemble the 2df curve ( from @xcite ) better than the data from @xcite . at higher redshifts the deviation between simulated and observed co - moving spatial density is increasing . in our model we clearly miss the earliest quasars which arise from exceptionally fast evolving mergers . despite this shortcoming of our results their overall agreement with observational data is remarkable .
SUMMARY:it is widely agreed upon that agn and quasars are driven by gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole . 
 the origin of the latter however still remains an open question . in this work we present the results of an extremely simple cosmological model combined with an evolutionary scenario in which both the formation of the black hole as well as the gas accretion onto it are triggered by major mergers of gas - rich galaxies . despite its very generous approximations 
 our model reproduces the quasar density evolution in remarkable agreement with observations .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the doublet parity model assumes , besides the nucleons , the presence of particles with opposite chirality named chiral partners . at high density environment as the one in neutron stars interior , there is the possibility of creating such heavy particles . the main difference between this model and the usual chiral model ( ref .  ) is that in this one there is a term of bare mass in the lagrangian density . this mass , called @xmath0 appears with fields that are a mixture of the fields of the particles and their chiral partners in such a way that it does not break chirality ( ref . ) .    it is assumed that the star is in chemical equilibrium and the baryons interact through the mesons @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( included in order to reproduce the high asymmetry between neutrons and protons ) . electrons are included to insure charge neutrality . the lagrangian density of the system contains besides the kinetic and the interaction terms an explicit symmetry breaking term in order to reproduce the masses of the pseudo - scalar mesons . the coupling constants of the baryons are adjusted to reproduce the baryonic vacuum masses . in the high - density limit the nucleon and its chiral partner have degenerate masses ( @xmath4 ) as the sigma field goes to zero and chiral symmetry is restored :    @xmath5\frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0 ^ 2}+m_0 ^ 2}\pm\frac{m_{n_+}-m_{n_-}}{2}\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_0}.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    a good candidate for the nucleon chiral parter is the n(1535 ) , but since the identification of chiral partners is still on its first steps we study the case with n(1200 ) and n(1500 ) for comparison . this variation has drastic consequences on the results . four different cases first studdied in ref .   are applied to neutron stars . when the density increases , the protons , the neutron and the proton chiral partners appear , respectively . since the matter is not symmetric , there is no need for the chiral partners to appear at the same rate . the transition to the chiral phase is abrupt for the cases with the fourth order autointeraction term of the vector mesons @xmath6 ( p2 and p4 ) because of the sudden appearance of the chiral partners ( fig . [ massp](a ) ) . # 1    ( # 1 )    the calculus of the mass of the star shows that bigger maximum values are reached for @xmath6 . that means that when @xmath7 increases , the value of the vectorial meson @xmath2 , related to it , decreases its value and consequently its repulsive effect in such a way that the star can hold smaller quantity of mass against collapse ( fig . [ massp](b ) ) . with increasing density .i.e . toward the center of the star , chiral partners begin to appear , reaching a point where they exist at the same rate as they corresponding particles . the decrease in the scalar condensates signals the restoration of the chiral phase . depending on the parameters , the phase transition turns out to be a continuous cross - over or of first order for p4 . the maximum mass of the star is higher when the coupling constant @xmath7 is set to zero ( p1 and p3 ) so in order to reproduce the most massive star observed , that has @xmath8 ( ref .  ) , the best option would be the p1 description , because although the p3 predicts a higher maximum mass for the star , its phase transition occurs at a chemical potential bigger than 1700 mev , too hight compared to predictions .    3 s. schramm 2003 _ phys.lett . _ b * 560 * 164 d. zschiesche , l. tolos , j. schaffner - bielich , r. pisarski 2005 _ j.phys . _ g * 31 * 935 d. j. nice , e . m. splaver , i. h. stairs , o . loemer , a. jessed , m. kraemer , j. m. cordes 2005 _ astrophys.j . _ * 634 * 1242

TEXT: it is known that the top quark is substantially more massive than the rest of the observed quarks . it is therefore worth to search for the physical mechanism that introduces the mass difference and at the same time use the top as a probe into new physics , which often couples to mass . in the presence of new physics it is expected that the coupling of the top would deviate from the standard model predictions . in particular one can construct a cp conserving effective lagrangian of the wtb vertex and parametrise the anomalous couplings with form factors . it is then possible to identify a set of physical observables @xcite . this analysis focuses specifically on the forward backward asymmetry of the b quarks from all hadronic @xmath0 decays . to calculate the asymmetry one needs first to identify the b quark jets , discriminate the @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks and identify @xmath0 events after the event reconstruction and the jet finding algorithms , in which all events are artificially forced into a six jet configuration , have been performed the analysis aims to identify all the jets that originated from b quarks .    for this task the lcfivertex flavour tagging package has been used@xcite . the procedure uses the zvtop - zvres  @xcite vertex finder followed by a series of algorithms calculating flavour discriminating variables and a neural network , which uses these discriminating variables to determine the flavour of the jet . the results produced from this algorithm in the benchmarking di - jet sample can be seen in figure  [ fig : btag2 ] . the results for the @xmath0 events can be seen in figure  [ fig : btag6 ] . sample.,width=264,height=181 ]     sample.,width=264,height=181 ] it is then possible to discriminate between @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks . in order to do this two algorithms are employed : the momentum weighted jet charge and the momentum weighted vertex charge . the algorithms are conceptually the same but they differ in the track selection . in the vertex charge algorithm all the tracks present in all the reconstructed secondary vertices are selected ; differently in the jet charge all the tracks present in the jet are considered . after the track selection is completed we weight the tracks with respect to their momentum since the most energetic tracks carry are more likely to more information about the charge of the @xmath1 quark . the vertex charge method is particularly good at discriminating @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons ( and hence the constituent quarks ) when at least one secondary vertex is reconstructed ( see figure  [ fig : bplus ] ) . this is by far the cleanest of the possibilities . the jet charge is instead useful in the more difficult and more frequent occurrences when either the hadron is a @xmath5 or @xmath6 or when a secondary vertex has not been reconstructed . after both the jet charge and the vertex charge are calculated it is possible to recombine them into a single discriminating value by using the probability distribution function derived at monte carlo level @xcite ( figure  [ fig : bbar ] ) . it is at this point essential to look at a method to identify well reconstructed hadronically decayed @xmath0 . this is meant to discriminate both the standard model background , at present not included in the analysis , and the non fully hadronically decaying @xmath0 events . by applying a set of cuts on number of reconstructed b jets ( figure  [ fig : bcut ] . ) , minimum y - cut of the event jet clustering algorithm , missing energy and mass of reconstructed w as well as other parameters , one is left with what can be considered as well reconstructed hadronic @xmath0 s . at present there is no cut on muon and electron identification , however these should be added in the near future .    on these remaining events a kinematic fit is performed with constraints on total momentum , total energy and masses of the two w s . this produces a top mass peak ( figure  [ fig : mass ] . ) , which is used to perform the final selection of reconstructed hadronic @xmath0 events . the efficiency of this reconstruction is approximately 24% with a purity of 97% , where the remaining events come from the leptonic decay channels . the events that passed all the top identification criteria and that have a well tagged @xmath1 and @xmath2 jets are used to plot the b quark forward backward asymmetry . the calculated asymmetries are 0.33 + /- 0.07 for the @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : asymmetry ] . ) quark and 0.14 + /- 0.09 for the @xmath1 quark . combining the results one gets 0.26 + /- 0.06 ; a value consistent with the inputted standard model sample ( 0.28 ) @xcite . the results are calculated in the centre of mass frame and hence are a combination of production and decay asymmetries . by calculating the b quark asymmetry in the top quark frame one can deconvolute the two contributions .
SUMMARY:we present a study of experimental determination of the wtb anomalous couplings in the @xmath0 process at the international linear collider in the framework of effective field theory . 
 the theory predicts several observables that are particularly sensitive to the couplings including the asymmetry of the bottom quark angular distributions . 
 these observables require excellent identification capabilities for the b quark in a detector . 
 we describe tools needed for the identification with particular emphasis on determination of the quark charge and b - tagging together with generic selections for the @xmath0 events . 
 the focus of the study is on the all hadronic decay channel which provides the largest statistics . in the study 
 we demonstrate advantages of the clean environment of the ilc that allow a precise measurement of the observables . 
 we also explain how this process can be used for optimisation of ilc detector in the context of the sid detector concept .

TEXT: medium - resolution echelle spectroscopy that is capable of @xmath0 radial velocity precision was first introduced to hungarian observatories in early 2012 . the instrument , the commercially available eshel echelle spectrograph of the french shelyak instruments ( thizy & cochard , 2011 ) offers an exceptional light throughput that allows better than @xmath1 radial velocities for 911th magnitude stars with typical integrations of 2060 minutes . with this precision a range of ground - based spectroscopic support work has become possible . the main light gathering instrument for the spectrograph is the 0.5 m rc telescope of the gothard astrophysical observatory ( gao ) , but thanks to its transportability it has regularly been used on the 1 m rcc telescope at piszkstet mountain station of the konkoly observatory ( po ) . the fiber injection and guiding unit of the spectrograph is attached to the cassegrain focus of the telescopes , while the spectrograph is located in a thermally isolated room . the light from the object and thar fibers is collimated and projected to an r2 echelle grating , which is typically used between orders # 29 and # 56 separated by a prism . the entire process of data acquisition is fully computer controlled . the system is surprisingly compact and lightweight and it is easy to carry and install on different telescopes . over the last 1.5 years more than @xmath2 scientific frames including about @xmath3 stellar spectra of about 180 stars have been recorded . doppler observations of exoplanet systems have been a very expensive technique , mainly due to the high costs of high - resolution stable spectrographs . however , recent advances in instrumentation enable affordable doppler planet detections with surprisingly small optical telescopes that have traditionally been neglected for this kind of studies . our target list includes well - known bright exoplanet host stars , as well as somewhat fainter objects from wasp and hatnet projects , e.g. hat - p-2 ( bakos , 2007 ) .    , which clearly shows the applicability of our technique for detection exoplanets with a relatively small rv amplitude.,scaledwidth=60.0% ] photometry of pulsating variables is a traditionally successful research field of the hungarian astronomy , but over the last century no spectroscopic observations were carried out in our observatories . with the acquisition and installation of a medium - resolution mobile echelle spectrograph our aim was to change this situation , especially in the case of cepheids . classical cepheid variables are well - known primary distance indicators owing to the @xmath4-@xmath5 relationship . companions to cepheids , however , complicate its applicability for distance determination ( szabados _ et al . _ , 2013 ) . binaries among cepheids are not rare at all : their frequency exceeds 50% for the brightest cepheids , while among the fainter cepheids an observational selection effect encumbers revealing binarity ( szabados , 2003 ) . in the case of pulsating variables , spectroscopic binarity ( sb ) manifests itself in a periodic variation of the @xmath6-velocity . in practice , the orbital radial velocity variation of the cepheid component is superimposed on the rv variations of pulsational origin .    the very first result of this work is pointing out the sb nature of the bright galactic cepheid v1344 aql by analysing old and our new radial velocity measurements ( szabados _ et al . _ , 2014 ) . two earlier data sets ( balona , 1981 and arenalloferro , 1984 ) already imply a slight shift between the annual mean velocities . supplemented with our new data , the merged phase diagram of all rv observations clearly shows a vertical shift between the mean values valid for the early 1980s and 2012 . though the difference is small , quality of the data and the identical treatment is a guarantee that the shift is real . regular monitoring of the rvs of a large number of cepheids will be instrumental in finding more long - period sbs among them . data to be obtained within the gaia astrometric space mission will certainly result in revealing many new sbs among cepheids brighter than 1314th magnitude . as to v1344 aql , we keep this cepheid among our targets . the authors would like to thank the konkoly observatory for using its 1 m rcc telescope and its infrastructure . the project has been supported by the city of szombathely under agreement no . s-11 - 1027 . l.  szabados thanks also estec for supporting his work under contract no . 4000106398/12/nl / kml . arellano ferro , a.  1984 , mnras , 209 , 481 bakos , g.  et  al . 2007 , apj , 670 , 826 balona , l.a .  1981 , the observatory , 101 , 205 szabados , l.  2003 , inf . bull . stars , 5394 szabados , l.  et  al . 2013 , mnras , 434 , 870 szabados , l.  et  al . 2014 , in preparation thizy , o. & cochard , f.  2011 , iaus , 272 , 282

TEXT: the quark model predicts heavy baryons containing single , doubly or triply heavy charm or bottom quarks having either spin1/2 or spin3/2 . so far , all heavy baryons with single charm quark have been discovered in the experiments . some of the heavy baryons with single bottom quark like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 baryons with spin1/2 as well as @xmath5 baryon with spin3/2 have been observed in the experiments ( for a review see for instance @xcite ) . in 2012 , the cms collaboration reported the observation of the @xmath6 state with spin3/2 @xcite . at present , among all possible doubly heavy baryon states only the spin1/2 @xmath7 charmed baryon have experimentally been observed by the selex collaboration @xcite . the experimental attempts , especially at lhcb , have still been continuing to complete the remaining members of the heavy baryons with one , two or three heavy quarks predicted by the quark model .    from the theoretical side , there are a lot of works in the literature devoted to the spectroscopy and decay properties of the heavy baryons containing single heavy quark . there are also dozens of works dedicated to the study of the properties of the doubly heavy baryons . however , there are limited numbers of works devoted to the investigation of the properties of the triply heavy baryons . the masses of the triply heavy baryons have been studied in framework of the various approaches such as effective field theory , lattice qcd , bag model , various quark models , variational approach , hyper central model , potential model and regge trajectory ansatz @xcite . the masses and residues of the triply heavy spin1/2 baryons for the ioffe current , as well as the masses of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons , are also calculated in @xcite in framework of the qcd sum rule approach . in the present work , we extend our previous work on the spectroscopy of the triply heavy spin1/2 baryons for the general form of the interpolating current @xcite to calculate the masses and residues of both positive and negative parity triply heavy spin3/2 baryons in framework of the qcd sum rules . we compare our results on the masses and residues of these baryons with the predictions of the existing approaches in literature @xcite . information on the masses of the triply heavy baryons can play essential role in understanding the heavy quark dynamics . the paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we derive qcd sum rules for the masses and residues of both negative and positive parity triply heavy spin3/2 baryons . section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the sum rules for the masses and residues of the triple heavy baryons . this section contains also a comparison of the obtained results with the predictions of other approaches existing in literature . in order to calculate the masses and residues of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons we start by the following two  point correlation function as the main object of the method : [ edhbtt01 ] _ ( q ) = i d^4x e^iqx 0 \ { _ ( x ) |_(0 ) } 0  , where @xmath8 is the time ordering operator , @xmath9 is the four  momentum of the corresponding triply heavy baryon and @xmath10 stands for its interpolating current , whose general form can written as [ edhbtt02 ] _ = 1 ^abc \{2 ( q^at c _ q^b ) q^c + ( q^at c _ q^b ) q^c }  , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are heavy quarks . the quark contents for all members of the triply heavy spin3/2 baryons are given in table 1 .

TEXT: the importance of studying the isolated galaxies is quite evident now . a well - defined , numerous , complete and homogeneous sample of isolated galaxies , which are situated in low - density regions is necessary as reference one to study properties of galaxies in groups and clusters . a special aspect is the investigation of physical processes in isolated galaxies to explain their star formation rate , chemical abundance , as well as global morphological properties . a good example of such a sample is the catalog of isolated galaxies ( karachentseva 1973=cig ) which contains 1050 galaxies in the northern sky with blue apparent magnitudes brighter than 15@xmath27 . here , we present a new catalog of isolated galaxies , 2mig , selected from the 2masx part of of the @xmath3- band 2mass survey ( jarrett et al . 2000 , skrutskie et al . 1997 ) , using a modified isolation criterion from cig . the cig isolation criterion has used the empirically chosen conditions : @xmath4 @xmath5 where indeces `` 1 '' and `` i '' refer to a fixed galaxy and its neighbours , respectively . according to them , the galaxy with a standard angular diameter @xmath6 is classified as isolated if all its significant neighbours with their angular diameters @xmath7 locate on the projected distances not closer than @xmath8 . physically , it means that isolated galaxy did not suffer essential gravitational influence from nearby galaxies during the last billion years . to select isolated galaxies from 2masx we changed the value `` s '' in ( 1 ) from 20 to 30 because the mean ir galaxy diameter is 1.5 times less than the standard optical one , @xmath9 this modified criterion was applied to 51572 2masx candidate galaxies with @xmath10 magnitudes being in the interval @xmath11 @xmath12 hereby , a huge number of 2mass galaxies with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 were taken part in the checking of isolation . the automatic selection has been performed using the pleinpot environment package developed by the postgresql global development group for reduction and analysis of astronomical data . as a result we obtained a sample of 4045 candidate objects , but 250 of them turn out to be non - galaxies : pns , star clusters and binary stars . the remaining 3795 were inspected than visually on dss-1 and dss-2 surveys using the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . the galaxies without significant neighbours both in optical and ir bands entered in the `` 2mass very isolated galaxy catalog '' i.e. 2mvig . there are 2493 of the 2mvig galaxies , or 4.8% among 2masx ones satisfying ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . if the significant neighbours have been detected on dss we checked their radial velocities using ned and leda databases . when the radial velocity difference was less than 500 km / s we excluded such candidate galaxy as a member of pair or group ;

TEXT: while it is widely agreed upon that galaxy - galaxy interactions and , in particular , mergers play a crucial role for the growth of supermassive black holes in quasars and also for providing the fuel for quasar activity , there is still dispute whether these black holes are of primordial nature or not . n - body simulations ( e.g. by @xcite ) show that the tidal forces in interacting galaxies can trigger strong gas inflows towards the center of the merger . the mass of this gas is sufficient to build a supermassive bh of @xmath0 and provide enough fuel for quasar activity . on the basis of the @xmath1-viscosity model by @xcite calculations by @xcite show that it takes less than @xmath2a from the merger to form a fully developed quasar even if no primordial supermassive bh was originally present . this model can be tested by comparing the resulting co - moving space density of quasars to those derived from observations ( e.g. @xcite ) . based on results by @xcite we assume an average time delay of @xmath3a between the merger and the peak quasar activity . the individual values of this delay depend , of course , on details like the size ( @xmath4 ) and initial mass ( @xmath5 ) of the disk . estimates of the relevant ( viscous ) timescale show its dependence @xmath6 . this leads to the  at first glance surprising  finding of the faster formation of the more massive black holes . for our present purpose , however , an average value of this delay serves its purpose . for more details of this model , we refer the reader to the contribution by duschl and strittmatter in this volume and in @xcite .    for our purpose it is sufficient to use a  test universe "" comprised of 50 000 galaxies . this test universe is expanding according to an einstein - de sitter - cosmology with a hubble constant of @xmath7 . our galaxies are treated as particles with a finite cross section and a thermal velocity dispersion of @xmath8 . in this framework we compute the merger rate for each simulated time bin ( @xmath9a ) by taking into account two different processes : direct geometrical hits and gravitationally driven mergers . for the first process we assume every galaxy to have a spherical cross section with a radius of 15 kpc . for the second process the cross section radius is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the mass of one galaxy and @xmath12 being the relative velocity between both . we assume a delay between the merger and the onset of the quasar phase of @xmath13a for the geometrical hit and @xmath14a for the gravitationally driven merger . the quasar phase in turn is assumed to last for another @xmath15a .    in our model the universe is treated in very simple manner : as an expanding spherical box . the size of this box is determined by deriving today s matter density from the assumed hubble constant ( @xmath16 ) and then using the friedmann - lematre - equation to calculate the according radius at any given time . we completely neglect structure formation and start our simulation with large galaxies ( @xmath17 ) already in place @xmath18a after the big bang . to account for the formation of galaxies we increase their number over the first @xmath13a of our simulation until the final number of 50 000 is reached ( see fig . [ horst02simul ] for the effect of this procedure ) . a. in panel b ) a constant galaxy formation rate and in panel c ) a gaussian formation rate were used the resulting co - moving space density of quasars is almost exactly the same . ] the comparison between our model results and observational data compiled by @xcite is shown in fig.[horst02obs ] . the quasar density evolution at lower redshifts and the position of the peak at @xmath19 match very well . please note that the x - ray selected sample contains lower luminosity agn in addition to quasars . in this respect it is natural that our results resemble the 2df curve ( from @xcite ) better than the data from @xcite . at higher redshifts the deviation between simulated and observed co - moving spatial density is increasing . in our model we clearly miss the earliest quasars which arise from exceptionally fast evolving mergers . despite this shortcoming of our results their overall agreement with observational data is remarkable .
SUMMARY:it is widely agreed upon that agn and quasars are driven by gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole . 
 the origin of the latter however still remains an open question . in this work we present the results of an extremely simple cosmological model combined with an evolutionary scenario in which both the formation of the black hole as well as the gas accretion onto it are triggered by major mergers of gas - rich galaxies . despite its very generous approximations 
 our model reproduces the quasar density evolution in remarkable agreement with observations .

TEXT: extended structures resembling young dwarf galaxies are found in tidal debris from galaxy interactions ( mirabel et  al . 1992 ; duc & mirabel 1994 ; hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky 1996 ) . star clusters form in abundance in the central regions of interacting galaxy pairs ( schweizer et  al . 1996 ; miller et  al . 1997 ; whitmore et  al . 1999 ; zepf et  al . 1999 ) . what physical conditions drive the formation of stars and determine the nature of structure that forms in different environments ? can star clusters also form in tidal debris , how widespread is star formation in the debris , and how similar is it between different tidal environments ? the image in figure 1 is a 1000 second exposure in the f555w filter obtained on 1999 march 24 . a f814w image was also obtained . point sources with @xmath0 are indicated , those in the tail with white circles and those out of the tail with white squares . although this field is crowded with foreground stars due to its low galactic latitude , it is apparent that the numerous point sources are preferentially in the regions containing tidal debris . 0.38 in    -0.4 in    -0.8 in    the colors , magnitudes , and sizes of these sources allow us to distinguish foreground and background contamination from star clusters in the debris . figure 2 illustrates that the brighter sources are relatively young star clusters ( i.e. hundreds of millions of years old ) , but some of the fainter ones could be individual stars . the reddest sources are most certainly foreground stars with @xmath1 apparent mostly from wf4 . there is an enhancement of point sources with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the relatively large spread of the @xmath4 colors indicates either a range of ages , or non  uniform extinction by dust . the central region of ngc 3256 also has a large number of young clusters that contribute 20% of the total b  band luminosity of the galaxy ( zepf et  al . 1999 ) .    in figure 3 , for the western tail , the @xmath4 color is plotted vs. the concentration index , defined as the difference between @xmath5 magnitudes measured in a 0.5and in a 3aperture . the solid circles represent sources in the tail regions while the open circles represent sources in regions outside the tail . clearly , the sources in the tail are on average larger , indicating that they are not point sources , and bluer . therefore , we confirm that there are many star clusters in this tail . in the eastern tail of ngc 3256 we also find a significant number of star clusters , but they are not as abundant as in the western tail . we have also obtained hst / wfpc2 v and i band images of the tidal debris of three other mergers : ngc 4038/9 , `` the antennae '' , ngc 7252 , `` atoms for peace '' , and ngc 3921 . we detect several cluster candidates in ngc 7252 and ngc 4038/9 , and several super star clusters in the debris of ngc 7252 and ngc 3921 . however , the debris of the remnant ngc 3256 by far contains the largest number of massive star clusters , both in the eastern and in the western tails . apparently , the conditions in this remnant are more conducive to formation of these clusters .    clearly , not all tidal debris is equally conducive to the formation of these clusters . ngc 3256 is not distinguished from the other pairs by age or by total mass . however , its two tidal tails are the only ones of the eight we have studied that _ do not _ contain tidal dwarf galaxies . ngc 7252 , for example , contains in its western tail a bright dwarf with prominent patches of star formation , and in its eastern tail an extended low surface brightness dwarf . in both dwarfs there are point sources with @xmath6 , indicating that star formation continues well after the merger @xmath7 million years ago ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) . perhaps the formation of small stellar structures ( star clusters ) and large stellar structures ( tidal dwarfs ) are mutually exclusive . detailed comparisons of cluster positions to high resolution 21  cm maps of content may also suggest factors that influence the formation and/or the packaging of stars .    a detailed report of results on the tidal debris in all four pairs , ngc 3256 , ngc 7252 , ngc 4038/9 , and ngc 3921 , has been submitted to the astronomical journal ( knierman et  al . 2000 ) . this work was supported by nasa / stsci ( grant go-07466.01 - 96a ) .
SUMMARY:star clusters can be found in galaxy mergers , not only in central regions , but also in the tidal debris . in both the eastern and western tidal tails of ngc 3256 
 there are dozens of young star clusters , confirmed by their blue colors and larger concentration index as compared to sources off of the tail . 
 tidal tails of other galaxy pairs do not have such widespread cluster formation , indicating environmental influences on the process of star formation or the packaging of the stars .

TEXT: the supernova remnant g296.5 + 10.0 was observed using the australia telescope compact array at 1.4 ghz with an angular resolution of 30 arcseconds . signals from the dual linear polarized feeds were combined to produce images of the remnant in linear polarisation . the rotation measure synthesis method ( brentjens & de bruyn , 2005 ) was employed to obtain an rm spectrum at each pixel in the image ( figure 1 ) . the 104 mhz bandwidth was split into 13 @xmath0 8 mhz spectral channels , giving sufficient coverage in @xmath1@xmath2 to remove any n@xmath3 ambiguities in the rm values . x - ray data in the energy range 0.12.4 kev were taken from the rosat archive , via nasa s skyview . these complimentary data allow us to estimate the electron density in the remnant . in order to disentangle the electron density ( n@xmath4 ) and line - of - sight magnetic field ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) we measured the x - ray intensity at every point in the rosat image , after regridding and smoothing them to match the atca image . rm is defined as the integral of n@xmath4 and @xmath5@xmath6 along the line of sight . the thermal x - ray surface brightness , s@xmath7 , is proportional to n@xmath4@xmath2 . therefore if rm and s@xmath7@xmath8 are correlated , the faraday rotation is occurring within the thermal plasma ( matsui et al . a plot of rm vs. s@xmath7@xmath8 ( figure 2 ) shows that there is no clear correlation between rm and s@xmath7@xmath8 in the remnant , which means that the rms originate from the ism / halo along the line - of - sight . therefore the rm variations across the remnant may reflect the structure of the magnetised interstellar medium ( haverkorn et al . 2004 ) and the smooth component may tell us about the overall magnetic field morphology within the remnant ( ransom et al . this will form the basis of our further analysis of these data . the following analytical steps will be taken : ( 1 ) modelling of the rm structure across the remnant to determine the large - scale structure and morphology of the magnetic field ( i.e. linear , spiral , toroidal ) in the remnant ( 2 ) analysis of smaller - scale rm variations across the remnant , to probe the turbulent scale - sizes in the ism and galactic halo .
SUMMARY:radio continuum emission from the supernova remnant g296.5 + 10.0 was observed using the australia telescope compact array . using a 104 mhz bandwidth split into 13 @xmath0 8 mhz spectral channels , it was possible to produce a pixel - by - pixel image of rotation measure ( rm ) across the entire remnant . 
 a lack of correlation between rm and x - ray surface brightness reveals that the rms originate from outside the remnant . using this information 
 , we will characterise the smooth component of the magnetic field within the supernova remnant and attempt to probe the magneto - ionic structure and turbulent scale sizes in the ism and galactic halo along the line - of - sight .

TEXT: against @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the quantity @xmath3 is found to equal @xmath4 ( equation  [ eq_18 ] ) . ] barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) have made the interesting claim that a combination of two photometric parameters , namely the effective radius @xmath5 and the mean effective surface brightness @xmath6 , can be used to predict supermassive black hole masses with a greater degree of accuracy than single quantities such as velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ) , luminosity ( graham 2007 and references therein ) or major - axis srsic index ( graham & driver 2007 ) . these latter relations have a total scatter in the @xmath0 direction of 0.310.34 dex .    here we check barway & kembhavi s ( 2007 ) claim that the total scatter in the @xmath0 direction , when using @xmath6 and @xmath1 as predictor quantities , is 0.25 dex ( and 0.19 dex when excluding the outlier ngc  4742 ) . a simple ordinary least squares regression analysis of @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 has been performed , in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the data for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 have been taken from table  1 in barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) . in addition to solving for the parameter @xmath3 in the above inset equation , we also solve for @xmath12 and @xmath13 to give the expression @xmath14 given the absence of reported errors on the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 in barway & kembhavi ( 2007 ) , no attempt has been made to include such measurement errors in the regression , and subsequently no attempt to quantify the intrinsic scatter has been made .      upon the exclusion of ngc  4742 , the optimal relation is @xmath16 and the scatter is reduced to 0.25 dex  which is the same level of scatter in the @xmath17@xmath18 relation upon the removal of two outliers ( graham & driver 2007 ) . this level of scatter is also equal to the value reported by marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) who also used a combination of two parameters ( @xmath5 and @xmath19 ) to predict @xmath17 . the low value of 0.19 dex reported by barway & kembhavi appears to have arisen by dividing the scatter in the @xmath1 direction ( 0.061 ) by the coefficient in front of the @xmath0 term in their equation  3 ( which is their fitted plane ) . this overlooks the three - dimensional nature of the plane and consequently results in the over - estimation of the plane s ability to predict black hole masses . an easy check is to compute the offset between the black hole masses listed in table  1 of barway & kembhavi and the values predicted from their plane ( their equation  3 ) , which can be re - written as @xmath20 doing so ( and excluding ngc  4742 ) the total rms scatter in the @xmath0 direction is 0.27 dex ( not 0.19 dex , and greater than the value of 0.25 dex obtained using the optimal plane constructed here ) .    in passing it is noted that three of the galaxies used by barway & kembhavi are known to be disc galaxies , or at least are not regular elliptical galaxies . m32 may likely be a stripped s0 galaxy ( e.g.  graham 2002 ) , while ngc 2778 is a disc galaxy ( e.g. rix , carollo & freeman 1999 ) , as is ngc 4564 ( trujillo et al . 2004 ; see also figure  6 in graham & driver 2007 ) . consequently , the effective radii and mean surface brightnesses which have been used for these galaxies do not pertain to the bulge . curiously , excluding these three galaxies ( while including ngc  4742 ) , the rms scatter is 0.33 dex . barway , s. , kembhavi , a.  2007 , apj , accepted ( arxiv:0705.1508 ) ferrarese , l. , merritt , d.  2000 , apj , 539 , l9 gebhardt , k. , et al . 2000 , aj , 119 , 1157 graham , a.w . 2002 , apj , 568 , l13 graham , a.w . 2007 , mnras , in press ( arxiv:0705.0618 ) graham , a.w . , driver , s.p . 2007 , apj , 655 , 77 marconi , a. , hunt , l.k . 2003 , apj , 589 , l21 rix , h .- w . , carollo , c.m . , freeman , k.  1999 , apj , 513 , l25 trujillo , i. , erwin , p. , asensio ramos , a. , graham , a.w . 2004 , aj , 127 , 1917

SUMMARY:the entropy is one of the most applicable uncertainty measures in many statistical and engineering problems . in statistical literature , 
 the entropy is used in calculation of the kullback - leibler ( kl ) information which is a powerful mean for performing goodness of fit tests . 
 ranked set sampling ( rss ) seems to provide improved estimators of many parameters of the population in the huge studied problems in the literature . 
 it is developed for situations where the variable of interest is difficult or expensive to measure , but where ranking in small sub - samples is easy . in this paper 
 , we introduced two estimators for the entropy and compare them with each other and the estimator of the entropy in simple random sampling ( srs ) in the sense of bias and root of mean square errors ( rmse ) . 
 it is observed that the rss scheme would improve this estimator . 
 the best estimator of the entropy is used along with the estimator of the mean and two biased and unbiased estimators of variance based on rss scheme , to estimate the kl information and perform goodness of fit tests for exponentiality and normality . 
 the desired critical values and powers are calculated . 
 it is also observed that rss estimators would increase powers .

TEXT: in high energy physics assessing the uncertainty of a function ( _ i.  e. _ , a probability measure on a space of functions ) from a finite set of experimental data points has become a subject of great interest in the last years . the case of structure functions in polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is interesting in this respect , because it provides a good testing ground for the fitting technique on a relatively small set of data .    in our analysis we have used the data for the virtual - photon scattering asymmetry @xmath0 , since in this case the theoretical assumptions are minimized , and then different settings for the reconstruction of @xmath1 can be tested separately . indeed , the extraction of the polarized structure function @xmath1 from the experimental measured asymmetries @xmath2 and @xmath3 is not so trivial : assumptions have to be made ( say , the choice of a parametrization for the unpolarized structure function ) and different experimental collaborations sometimes quote different results . once a fit of @xmath0 is provided , such a parametrization might be an ideal input for a fit based on factorization scheme - invariant evolution equations aiming to a precise determination of @xmath4 , as proposed in @xcite . in @xcite we have adopted the technique presented in @xcite to the available data for polarized dis . here we present some details of our analysis not included in @xcite , as an example of application of our results . the first step is the propagation of experimental information from the finite set of data points to the parametrization . since experimental data are occurrences of a probability distribution , we use a monte carlo technique to sample such a distribution . this sampling is performed by generating @xmath5 artificial replicas of data following a multi - gaussian distribution centered on each data point with the variance given by the experimental error @xmath6 where @xmath7 are gaussian distributed random numbers , @xmath8 is is the total uncorrelated error , obtained by summing in quadrature the statistical and uncorrelated systematic errors , @xmath9 is the normalization multiplicative error . at this stage of the analysis we neglect correlated systematic errors since they are not available for all the experiments considered . moreover the measurement of polarized structure functions is dominated by statistical errors . the number of monte carlo replicas of the data is determined by the requirement that the average over the replicas reproduces the features ( central values and errors ) of the original experimental data with a given accuracy . in practice here we use @xmath10 . the second step is to build a representation of the probability measure in the space of asymmetry functions . this construction can be done by taking a given functional form , and determining its parameters by fitting each of the generated replicas . in order to minimize the bias due to the assumptions made on the shape of the fitted functions we make use of a redundant parametrization , that is a parametrization with a sufficiently large number of parameters so that not only the underlying physical law , but also the statistical fluctuations of the data could be reproduced . of course within this framework over - fitting is allowed and the minimization becomes crucial . in practise we use a neural network which has 20 tunable parameters to perform a fit to 100 data points and we stop the minimization , when we start fitting statistical noise ( see @xcite for details ) .    at the end of this procedure any observable can be computed from the fit by averaging over the sample . as an example , if we neglect the contribution of @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 as an application and a test of our result , we compare our extraction of @xmath1 to clas data @xcite , which have not been used in the fit . in figure [ fig : kinematics ] we show the kinematic range spanned by the data used in the fit ( see also table [ tab : data ] ) together with the bin of clas data against which we want to check our parametrisation . as it can be easily seen most of the clas data are in a region where our fit is asked to extrapolate , both in @xmath13 and in @xmath14 .    comparing our extraction of @xmath0 with data ( see figure [ fig : g1 ] left pad ) , we notice that our description and clas data are compatible within 2-@xmath15 error band , and that resonances are naturally averaged by the fit . .general features of experimental data used in the fit [ cols=""<,<,<,^"",options=""header "" , ]     in order to obtain the polarized structure function @xmath1 , we have to supplement our parametrization with some assumptions , whose impact can be tested easily once a parametrization of @xmath0 is given . in the present analysis we take @xmath16 , and @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is given from the slac parametrization @xcite , and @xmath20 from @xcite . we have @xmath21\ , , \label{eq : g1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath22 equations ( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2ww ] ) explicitly show how to evaluate any quantity depending on the asymmetry , together with its associated error , in a straightforward way . the result shown in the right pad of figure [ fig : g1 ] is consistent with the one given in @xcite .         and reconstruction of @xmath23 compared to clas data not used in the fit , title=""fig : "" ]   and reconstruction of @xmath23 compared to clas data not used in the fit , title=""fig : "" ]    we have presented a fit based on a large fraction of the available experimental data for the asymmetry @xmath0 , and we have applied this result to predict some of the remaining data that were not included in the fit and lie in a region where our asymmetry needs to be extrapolated . we find the result of this comparison to be satisfactory . we conclude that our parametrization provides an interesting tool to study quark - hadron duality since no qcd evolution is used and averages of the structure function over resonances are naturally guaranteed by the smoothness of the fit ( see @xcite and references therein for further details on a usual approach to quark - hadron duality ) . ldd is supported by an stfc advanced fellowship .
SUMMARY:we present a fit of the virtual - photon scattering asymmetry of polarized deep inelastic scattering which combines a monte carlo technique with the use of a redundant parametrization based on neural networks . 
 we apply the result to the analysis of clas data on a polarized proton target .
Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: overlap fermions @xcite are a realisation of chiral symmetry on the lattice . given some reasonable hermitian - dirac operator @xmath1 , we can deform @xmath1 into a chiral action through the overlap formalism , @xmath2 unfortunately , the matrix sign function @xmath3 is difficult to evaluate and is typically approximated by a sum over poles @xcite which can be evaluated using a multi - shift conjugate gradient ( cg ) solver @xcite . this is an iterative approximation where the number of iterations for a given accuracy increases with the condition number of the kernel , @xmath4 . usually the hermitian wilson - dirac operator is used as the overlap kernel . its low - lying spectrum is characterised by a handful of isolated eigenmodes which can be very small , increasing the condition number , @xmath0 , unacceptably . these eigenmodes can be projected out of the basic operator , reducing its condition number to a numerically acceptable level , and then dealt with explicitly @xcite . unfortunately , as the spectrum rapidly becomes dense , projecting out low - lying modes can only help one so far . an alternative is to use a kernel with an improved spectrum , that is , where the region of dense modes is shifted away from zero . the flic ( fat link irrelevant clover ) @xcite action possesses this property . spectral flow diagrams give us a good comparison of the two different kernels , flic and wilson , as they allow us to see directly the difference in the qualitative structure of the low - lying spectra of the two actions @xcite . figure [ fig : flow ] displays the flow of the lowest 15 eigenvalues as a function of @xmath5 for an ensemble of 10 mean - field improved symanzik configurations at @xmath6 and size @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . as we are interested in the magnitude of the low - lying values rather than their sign , we illustrate @xmath9 vs @xmath5 . we see the wilson spectrum is very poor , with a high density of very small eigenmodes and no gap away from zero . by contrast , the flic action ( which has a clover term , and irrelevant operators constructed from four - sweep ape - smeared links ) possesses a spectrum which is clearly superior to that of the wilson . not only has the density of very small modes been significantly reduced , the region where the spectrum becomes dense has been shifted much further away from zero . this improvement in the spectrum results in the flic action being much better conditioned than the wilson action . in figure [ fig : kappa ] we examine the condition number , @xmath0 , of the two actions as a function of @xmath5 . the condition number is calculated after having projected out the lowest 15 eigenmodes on the 2 lattices that are shown . the finer lattice is the same as the one used in the spectral flow plots , and the coarser lattice uses the same gluonic action , but is an @xmath10 lattice at @xmath11 , corresponding to a lattice spacing of a=0.165(2 ) . the points are the mean condition numbers across the ensembles , and the error bars indicate the minimum and maximum condition numbers , giving an idea of the variation in @xmath0 . there have been suggestions to accelerate the computation of the sign function by using non - pertubatively improved gauge actions @xcite . our results are based on symanzik improved gauge configurations and further improvements arising from the use of the flic action are in addition to that of using improved gluon - field configurations . this is verified by performing a similar analysis on gluonic configurations using a monte - carlo renormalisation group improved action . some preliminary results of this investigation using dbw2 glue @xcite are displayed in figure [ fig : kappa ] , with a full report given elsewhere @xcite . we note that at a fixed lattice spacing , dbw2 glue improves the condition number for both actions , although the effect is much more pronounced for the wilson action . saving iterations ( by reducing the condition number ) does not necessarily reduce the most important quantity , compute time . shifting from a standard wilson action to a partially smeared action means that we now have two sets of gauge fields , the standard and smeared links . additionally , the standard spin - projection trick is no longer applicable , possibly providing an additional factor of two in compute time needed . however , it can be shown that the spin projection trick can be generalised to include partially smeared actions as well @xcite . this results in paying at most a single factor of two compute - time for a flic - fermion matrix - vector multiplication . as there is significant additional expense in the evaluation of the overlap sign function , we get to keep the majority of the speedup gained by reducing the number of iterations @xcite . this results in flic - overlap fermions being approximately twice as fast as the standard wilson - kernel formulation . regardless of the kernel used , all overlap fermions are free from @xmath12 errors . however , different kernels may in general produce actions which differ at @xmath13 . as a first investigation into this matter , we have calculated the quark propagator in momentum space using flic - overlap fermions , essentially performing the same calculation that has been done earlier with the standard overlap action @xcite . the chirally extrapolated mass function is shown in figure [ fig : quarkprop ] , with a full report given elsewhere @xcite .    , at @xmath14.,scaledwidth=48.0% ] in the overlap formalism one is free to choose the argument of the sign function , the overlap kernel , so long as one uses a reasonable dirac operator . the standard kernel choice is the wilson action . by choosing the flic action , one can obtain a significant reduction in the compute time needed for overlap fermions . we have reviewed the work that has been done to date using flic overlap fermions , including some preliminary results into the physical structure of the quark propagator .
SUMMARY:the action of the overlap - dirac operator on a vector is typically implemented indirectly through a multi - shift conjugate gradient solver . 
 the compute - time required depends upon the condition number , @xmath0 , of the matrix that is used as the overlap kernel . 
 while the wilson action is typically used as the overlap kernel , the flic ( fat link irrelevant clover ) action has an improved condition number and provides up to a factor of two speedup in evaluating the overlap action . 
 we summarize recent progress on the use of flic overlap fermions .

TEXT: lattice qcd plays an important role in understanding the n * spectrum . one can systematically study the spectrum sector by sector , with the ability to dial the quark masses , and dissect the degrees of freedom . the rich structure of the excited baryon spectrum , as tabulated by the particle data group  @xcite , provides a fertile ground for exploring how the internal degrees of freedom in the nucleon are excited and how qcd works in a wider context . one outstanding example is the parity splitting pattern in the low - lying n * spectrum . the splittings are a direct manifestation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd . without it , qcd predicts parity doubling in the baryon spectrum . the experimental effort on excited baryons has intensified in recent years at jlab and other accelerators , generating renewed debate on how well these states are known . the star - rating system on the observed states is a reflection of the current situation . given that state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulations have produced a ground - state spectrum that is very close to the observed values  @xcite , it is important to extend the success beyond the ground states . there exist already a number of lattice studies of the n * spectrum  @xcite , focusing mostly on the spin-1/2 sector . all established a clear splitting from the ground state . in this study , we explore the possibility of calculating the excited baryon states in the spin-3/2 sector with isospin 1/2 . we consider the following interpolating field with the quantum numbers @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath1 despite having an explicit parity by construction , the interpolating field couples to both positive and negative parity states . a parity projection is needed to separate the two . in the large euclidean time limit , the correlator with dirichlet boundary condition in the time direction and zero spatial momentum becomes @xmath2 @xmath3\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a function common to both terms . the relative sign in front of @xmath5 provides the solution : by taking the trace of @xmath6 with @xmath7 , one can isolate @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . it is well - known that a spin-3/2 interpolating field couples to both spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 states . a spin projection can be used to isolate the individual contributions in the correlation function @xmath10 . using the spin-3/2 projection operator  @xcite , @xmath11 the spin-3/2 part can be projected out by @xmath12 while the spin-1/2 part by @xmath13 obviously , they satisfy the relation @xmath14    the anisotropic gauge action of  @xcite , and the anisotropic d234 quark action of  @xcite are used . both have tadpole - improved tree - level coefficients . a @xmath15 lattice with @xmath16 fm and anisotropy @xmath17 is used . in all , 100 configurations are analyzed . on each configuration 9 quark propagators are computed using a multi - mass solver , with quark masses ranging from approximately 780 to 90 mev . the corresponding mass ratio @xmath18 is from 0.95 to 0.65 . a gauge - invariant gaussian - smeared source is used . the source is located at @xmath19 . figure  [ corr_n3tr_pos ] presents results for the correlation function in the positive - parity nucleon channel at the smallest quark mass considered . spin projection reveals two different exponentials from the spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 parts , with the spin-3/2 state being heavier than the spin-1/2 one ( a steeper fall - off ) , in agreement with the ordering in experiment . the expected relation in eq . ( [ sum ] ) is indeed satisfied numerically , providing a non - trivial check of the calculation . a further check of the calculation is provided by the fact that the mass extracted from @xmath20 is degenerate with that from the conventional @xmath21 for the nucleon ground state using the interpolating field @xmath22 . one would get a false signal from the dominant spin-1/2 state without spin projection . the large error bars indicate sensitive cancellations in the projection procedure . figure  [ corr_n3tr_neg ] shows the similar plot in the negative - parity nucleon channel . here the relation in eq . ( [ sum ] ) is also satisfied , even though the signal is dominated by the @xmath23 state . the results also show a similar mass for the @xmath24 state and the @xmath23 state , in accord with the experimental states of @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are close to each other . figure  [ ratio3_pos ] presents results for the mass ratio extracted from the correlation functions for the @xmath27 state to the nucleon ground state as a function of the mass ratio @xmath28 . mass ratios have minimal dependence on the uncertainties in determining the scale and the quark masses , so that a more reliable comparison with experiment can be made . figure  [ ratio3_neg ] shows the similar plot for the @xmath29 state . these ratios appear headed in the right direction compared to experiment . we have obtained clear signals for spin-3/2 n * states on an anisotropic lattice with smeared operators and 100 configurations . states of both negative- and positive - parity are isolated with a parity projection technique . the need for spin projection is further demonstrated . the results for the pattern of the splittings appears consistent with experiment , but more study is needed to address systematic errors . this work is supported in part by u.s . department of energy under grant de - fg02 - 95er40907 , the australian research council , and is part of the effort by the lattice hadron physics collaboration  @xcite . the computing resources at nersc and jlab have been used .
SUMMARY:we report n * masses in the spin-3/2 sector from a highly - improved anisotropic action . 
 states with both positive and negative parity are isolated via a parity projection method . 
 the extent to which spin projection is needed is examined . 
 the gross features of the splittings from the nucleon ground state show a trend consistent with experimental results at the quark masses explored .

TEXT: the number , luminosity or mass of the entire globular cluster ( gc ) system normalized to the host galaxy luminosity or mass defines the fundamental quantities specific frequency ( @xmath3 ) , luminosity ( @xmath0 ) , specific mass ( @xmath4 ) and specific number ( @xmath5 ) of gcs ( cf . eqns [ eqn : sn ] ) . these gc scaling relations indicate how efficiently galaxies form gcs per unit of their luminosity or mass . those has been observed to vary significantly , being high for dwarf and giant galaxies ( @xcite ) , and with a minimum at a galaxy luminosity of @xmath6mag ( @xmath7 ) . that is , the two extreme galaxy mass regimes , dwarfs and giants , seemingly form old gcs in similar proportions . this scaling relations provide important observational constraints and test for models of star , gc and galaxy formation ( @xcite ) . in georgiev et al.(2010 ) , we investigate this trend with observations of gc populations of a large sample late - type dwarf galaxies with hst / acs ( @xcite ) . in order to sample the entire range in galaxy mass , environment , and morphology we augment our sample with data with data from the literature . we find that @xmath8 relations between the gcs scaling parameters and galaxy luminosity holds irrespective of galaxy morphological type and @xmath9 on average , early - type galaxies have @xmath10 higher @xmath0-values than late - types at the same luminosity . to investigate the observed trends , which have not yet been conclusively explained , we derive theoretical predictions of gc system scaling parameters as a function of the total host galaxy mass based on the models of dekel@xmath11brinboim ( 2006 ) in which star - formation processes ( i.e. thermal properties of the gas ) are regulated by stellar / supernova feedback below a stellar mass of @xmath12 , and by virial shocks ( hot stream ) above it , causing a suppression of star formation . specific frequency and luminosity @xmath13 can be related to the galaxy halo mass by defining the gc formation efficiency : @xmath14 . dekel & birnboim ( 2006 ) model predicts @xmath15 below and @xmath16 above galaxy stellar mass @xmath17 . @xmath18 where @xmath19 are observationally derived normalization constants , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the typical gc mass and mass - to - light ratio . the functional relations ( eqs [ eqn : snn ] ) describe remarkably well the observed distributions ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) . this supports that gcs form in proportion to the strength of the host potential ( galaxy mass ) as well as the effect on the gc formation efficiency by the physical mechanisms in the dekel & birnboim model of galaxy evolution ( thermal properties , shock stability and cooling physics of gas due to feedback from sne , uv on dust , photoionization , agn and dynamical friction ) . therefore , this model is a good representation of the gc formation efficiency ( @xmath1 ) . a better model should , in addition , take into account variations in the individual galaxy star formation history , merging history , conditions for cluster formation and destruction and the stochastic nature of star formation at low galaxy mass . observations of gcss of late - type , spiral galaxies in the high galaxy mass regime are necessary to probe whether their gc formation efficiencies are statistically different than that of early - type galaxies at same galaxy mass . georgiev , i.,y . , puzia , t.,h . , goudfrooij , p. , hilker , m. , 2010 , mnras , 406 , 1967 , w.  e. 1991 , ara&a , 29 , 543 , b.  w. & lotz , j.  m. 2007 , apj , 670 , 1074 , e.  w. , jordan , a. , cote , p. , et  al . 2008 , apj , 681 , 197 , d.  e. 1999 , aj , 117 , 2398 , d.  a. 2005 , apjl , 635 , l137 , a. , puzia , t.  h. , & matteucci , f. 2007 , apj , 665 , 295 , a.  l. & gnedin , o.  y. 2010 , apj , 718 , 1266 , i.  y. , goudfrooij , p. , puzia , t.  h. , & hilker , m. 2008 , aj , 135 , 1858 , i.  y. , puzia , t.  h. , hilker , m. , & goudfrooij , p. 2009 , mnras , 392 , 879 , a. & birnboim , y. 2006 , mnras , 368 , 2
SUMMARY:for the full galaxy mass range , we find that previously observed trends of globular cluster ( gc ) system scaling parameters ( number , luminosity or mass of all gcs in a galaxy normalized to the host galaxy luminosity or mass , e.g. @xmath0 ) as a function of galaxy mass , holds irrespective of galaxy type or environment . the @xmath0 value of early - type galaxies is , on average , twice that of late - types . 
 we derive theoretical predictions which describe remarkably well the observed gc system scaling parameter distributions given an assumed gc formation efficiency ( @xmath1 ) , i.e. the ratio of total mass in gcs to galaxy halo mass . 
 it has a mean value of @xmath2 , and increasing scatter toward low galaxy mass . 
 the excess @xmath1-values of some massive galaxies compared to expectations from the mean model prediction , may be attributed to an efficient gc formation , inefficient production of field stars , accretion of low - mass high-@xmath1 galaxies or likely a mixture of all these effects .

TEXT: our data consist of 54 b , 57 v and 52 i frames taken at the 1.54 cm eso - danish telescope in july 1999 . the data reduction was performed using the isis package ( alard 2000 ) , which is based on the method of image subtraction . this technique is particularly powerful when searching for variability in crowded fields , both in terms of detection rate and in terms of photometric accuracy . as an example , in fig . 1 we show for comparison the v light curves of 3 rr lyrae variables that were measured by layden & sarajedini 2000 ( hereafter ls2000 ) with traditional techniques ( psf - fitting ) and by us with isis . with respect to the previous study by ls2000 , the number of detected variable stars has increased from 117 to 211 , in particular more small amplitude variables ( rrc and long period rrab ) have been found . _ m54 can now be classified as intermediate in the oosterhoff groups_.    the reddening can be estimated from the ( v  i ) colors at minimum light of the rrab - type pulsators and is e(v i)=0.17 @xmath0 0.02 mag . assuming [ fe / h]=1.55 for m54 , and the relation mv(rr ) = 0.20 [ fe / h ] + 0.98 ( fernley et al . 1998 ) , we obtain a distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath1 = 17.07 for m54 , in a distance scale where the lmc has a true distance modulus 18.44 . we have obtained an improved cmd , where one can clearly identify the contributions of the galactic disk and bulge contaminating components , the m54 red giant branch ( rgb ) , and the sgr intermediate and metal - rich rgbs .    for the rgb stellar components the metallicity has been estimated by comparison with template rgb ridge lines of galactic globular clusters at various metallicities ( saviane et al . 2000 ) . for the rr lyraes the metallicity has been estimated by fourier decomposition of the v light curves ( kovacs & jurcsik 1997 ) . in fig . 2 we show the metallicity distributions for the rgb stars of the sgr field ( about half a degree away from m54 - bellazzini et al . 1999 ) , the rgb stars in the field of m54 , and the rr lyrae variables in the field of m54 . @xmath2 in the field centered on m54 one can identify the same components as above , at [ fe / h ] = 1.55 and 0.6 , albeit with different relative proportions . the hint of the component at 2.1 is not seen , possibly because included in the decontamination from the galactic disk / bulge contribution . a small but detectable intermediate sgr population appears at about 1.2 . @xmath2 the rr lyrae stars belong to populations at three different metallicities , i.e. 1.55 ( produced by m54 and the sgr field ) , and 1.2 and 2.1 ( produced by the sgr field only ) . the metal - rich sgr field population at 0.6 , as expected , does not produce rr lyraes . alard , c. 2000 , a&as , 144 , 363 bellazzini , m. , ferraro , f.r . , buonanno , r. 1999 , mnras , 307 , 619 fernley , j. , skillen , i. , carney , b.w . 1998 , mnras 293 , l61 kovacs , g. , jurcsik , j. 1997 , a&a , 322 , 218 layden , a.c . , sarajedini , a. 2000 , aj , 119 , 1760 saviane , i. , rosenberg , a. , piotto , g. , aparicio , a. 2000 , a&as , 144 , 5

SUMMARY:recently , covariance descriptors have received much attention as powerful representations of set of points . in this research 
 , we present a new metric learning algorithm for covariance descriptors based on the dykstra algorithm , in which the current solution is projected onto a half - space at each iteration , and runs at @xmath0 time . we empirically demonstrate that randomizing the order of half - spaces in our dykstra - based algorithm significantly accelerates the convergence to the optimal solution .

TEXT: precise cross - sections of secondary hadron production from the interactions of protons and pions with nuclei are , _ inter alia _ , of importance for the understanding of the characteristics of muons from the decay of pions that are produced by the proton driver of a neutrino factory . surprisingly , inclusive differential cross - sections of hadron production in the interactions of few gev/_c _ protons with nuclei are known only within a factor of two to three . consequently , the harp detector was designed to carry out a programme of systematic and precise measurements of hadron production by protons and pions with momenta from 1.5 to 15  gev/_c_.    the detector combined a forward spectrometer with a large - angle spectrometer . the latter comprised a cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) around the target and an array of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) that surrounded the tpc . the purpose of the tpc was track reconstruction and particle identification by . the purpose of the rpcs was to complement the particle identification by time of flight . the harp experiment was performed at the cern proton synchrotron in 2001 and 2002 with a set of stationary targets ranging from hydrogen to lead , including beryllium . we have measured  @xcite the inclusive cross - sections of the large - angle production ( polar angle @xmath3 in the range from 20 to 125@xmath4 ) of secondary protons and charged pions in the interactions with a 5% @xmath0 beryllium target of protons and pions with beam momenta of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10  gev/_c_. for the work reported here , only the harp large - angle spectrometer was used  @xcite . its salient technical characteristics are stated in table  [ lacharacteristics ] . the good particle identification capability stemming from  in the tpc and from time of flight in the rpc s is demonstrated in fig .

SUMMARY:precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and of neutrino  nucleon cross - sections require a good understanding of neutrino beams : flux as a function of energy , transverse beam profile , and flavour composition . 
 for this , hadron production spectra in proton  nucleus collisions are essential .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: temperature profiles of galaxy clusters are of great importance for two main reasons : firstly they allow us to measure the total mass of these systems through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and secondly they provide informations on the thermodynamic state of the intra cluster medium ( hereafter icm ) . measurements of temperature profiles have been performed with the the first generation of x - ray satellites carrying telescopes operating in the medium energy band ( 2 - 10 kev ) , namely asca and bepposax . a detailed description of results obtained with these experiments may be found in de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) and refs . therein .    in the last 3 years various authors have published xmm - newton temperature profiles of individual clusters . arnaud et al .

( 1996 ) : @xmath16 using published cluster mean temperatures and redshifts .    visual inspection of fig.1 , where we report the individual xmm - newton temperature profiles , shows that the profiles are about isothermal from 0.10 to @xmath17 ; beyond @xmath17 there seems to be a decline . it is also clear that points at @xmath18 are heavily fluctuating and tend to have larger errors . we have modelled the xmm - newton profiles in fig . 1 with a power law and converted the slope into the polytrophic gas index accordingly to the calculation reported in the appendix of de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) . in the range @xmath19 we have obtained a polytrophic index @xmath20 , which is close to the isothermal value 1 . whereas , for @xmath21r@xmath22 we have found @xmath23 , which is formally above the adiabatic limit of 5/3 , although consistent at the 68% confidence level with values below 5/3 . the drop in the profiles at @xmath12 0.55 r@xmath24 ( clearly visible in fig . 2 ) highlights a possible problem in the xmm - newton profiles . the binned error - weighted average temperature profile computed from the 15 clusters is shown in fig . 2 , where we also plot the bepposax cool core and non cool core clusters profiles ( see de grandi & molendi 2002 for details ) . we have added here to the bepposax cool core clusters the ophiuchus cluster . the xmm - newton and bepposax profiles are in good agreement between 0.05 and 0.25 @xmath0 . from 0.25 to about 0.5 @xmath0 both profiles decline , however the bepposax profile does so more rapidly than the xmm - newton profile . the presence of a temperature jump , at the limit of convective stability , at the largest radii explored with xmm - newton , hints to a problem possibly related to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the outermost cluster regions and to the difficulties in operating a correct background subtraction ( see molendi these proceedings for a discussion of this issue ) .max_lengthrequest_suffix"

TEXT: charm hadrons in photon nucleus interactions at typical fixed target experiment energies , are expected to be produced predominantly by photon - gluon fusion followed by fragmentation .    as @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks in the @xmath3 process are produced at the same rate , apart from a tiny @xmath2 excess appearing from next to leading order ( nlo ) contributions  @xcite , the final charm hadron and anti - hadron cross sections should be approximately the same . furthermore , associated production , which together with leading particle effects ( lpe ) has been observed to play an important role in the hadroproduction asymmetries for charm and anti - charm particles  @xcite . this should not induce charge asymmetries in photoproduction since the effects are the same for particles than for anti - particles within this scheme . however , the slac hybrid photon facility collaboration  @xcite has reported a noticeable charge asymmetry in meson photoproduction . this result has been confirmed more recently by the e691  @xcite and the e687  @xcite charm photoproduction experiments . actually , the e687 collaboration presented results on charge asymmetries in @xmath4 and @xmath5 photoproduction which are consistent , at a three sigma level , with a positive asymmetry . results on @xmath6 , @xmath7 and even @xmath8 photoproduction asymmetries , from both the e687 and the e691 experiments , are less clear since the error bars are still large to be conclusive , but all these measurements seems to indicate a small charge asymmetry ( see table  [ tab1 ] for a summary of the e687 and e691 results ) . .@xmath9 antiparticle / particle ratio . the @xmath10 was the statistically most significant sample of the e691 experiment ( they saw a raw signal of @xmath11 events , see ref . results of the e687 collaboration were taken from ref .

[ fig5 ] , the @xmath12 and @xmath13 become less important as the photon energy rises up , indicating that any charge asymmetry arising from the resolved photon component must decrease with the photon energy , @xmath14 . we have tried to explain the observed charge asymmetry in photoproduction experiments using the resolved component of the photon . we have found that even when this part is small for typical fixed target energies the charge asymmetry raised from recombination is within errors consistent with the more recent measurements of e687 . the model of ref . @xcite gives a larger asymmetry than our approach but given the accuracy of experimental data it is still hard to be conclusive on the responsible production mechanism . we expect that e831/focus  @xcite with its one million of charm reconstructed candidates shed light on the issue .
SUMMARY:charm quarks are expected to be produced mainly by the photon - gluon fusion mechanism in @xmath0 interactions . however , a small part of the total charm cross section originates in similar processes to those appearing in charm hadroproduction through the resolved ( hadronic ) component of the photon . 
 although the contribution of the resolved part of the photon is small at fixed target energies , it can help to understand the small but sizeable charge asymmetries measured in charm hadron photoproduction experiments .

TEXT: coating surfaces with monomolecular layers is an important part of many modern technologies . usually it is preceded by spreading under the action of intermolecular forces . self - similar solutions of the equation that describes plane spreading due to intermolecular forces represent profiles of drops without contact lines @xcite . in the present work , self - similar solutions are found also for axisymmetrical spreading . both plane and axisymmetrical solutions are matched with the solutions of equations that describe plane or axisymmetrical spreading of monomolecular layers . consider a liquid layer spreading over a plane rigid substrate ( see fig.[1 ] ) . the density @xmath0 and viscosity @xmath1 of the liquid are much larger than those of the environment ( air ) . let the layer be sufficiently thin and have sufficiently small maximal local inclination of the free surface so that the lubrication theory approximation can be used . the rigid substrate is implied to be much thicker than the characteristic length of intermolecular forces . then axisymmetrical and plane spreading is described by the following equation for the local thickness of the liquid layer , @xmath2 , @xmath3    +    3k\zeta^{-4 } { \frac{\partial\zeta}{\partialr } }   \right\ } \right ) . \label{m : se}\ ] ] here , @xmath4 for plane symmetric spreading and @xmath5 for axisymmetrical spreading , @xmath6 is the distance from the plane ( @xmath4 ) or axis ( @xmath5 ) of symmetry , @xmath7 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath8 is the surface tension , @xmath9 is the effective hamaker constant ( see @xcite ) . if the term with @xmath8 in ( [ m : se ] ) is neglected , the resulting equation coincides with that written down in @xcite . self - similar solutions of the equation ( [ m : se ] ) exist only for special cases when one of the forces , gravitational , capillary or intermolecular , dominates so that the two others can be neglected . in what follows , the thickness of the layer is supposed to be so small that gravitational and capillary forces can be neglected . the self - similar solutions of the equation that results from ( [ m : se ] ) when the terms with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being neglected are as follows @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an arbitrary dimensionless parameter , @xmath13 is the volume ( volume per unit transversal length for @xmath4 ) of the liquid contained in the region @xmath14 at the initial instant @xmath15 , @xmath16 being an arbitrarily chosen distance . for @xmath4 the solutions coincide with those in @xcite . when a layer of a liquid reaches some thickness , @xmath17 , of the order of the molecular size , the liquid forms a monomolecular layer which can be in liquid or gaseous two - dimensional state . the moving boundary between monomolecular and liquid phases ( see fig.[1 ] ) is determined by some value , @xmath18 , of the variable @xmath6 for which the following equation and initial condition are satisfied @xmath19 regarding that all mass of the liquid is in liquid phase at @xmath15 and using ( [ bc : zeta ] ) , one determines @xmath18 in terms of @xmath16 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total mass of the liquid contained in the spreading drop : @xmath22 where @xmath12 is the non - zero positive solution of the equation @xmath23 the liquid monomolecular layer forms a distinct boundary with the uncovered region of the surface of the substrate which is determined by some value , @xmath24 , of the variable @xmath6 . let the surface mass density of the layer , @xmath25 , be constant . then , using the condition of the conservation of the total mass of the spreading liquid , one obtains @xmath26 at @xmath27 all the liquid is in monomolecular phase and stops spreading . if the monomolecular layer is gaseous , it has no boundary with the uncovered surface , and the distribution of the surface mass density , @xmath28 , satisfies the differential equation for the surface diffusion @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the surface diffusion coefficient , with the boundary and initial conditions that follow from continuity of surface mass flux and mass densities on the boundary between the phases and absence of monomolecular phase at @xmath15 @xmath31 at @xmath27 all the liquid is in monomolecular phase , but continues spreading so that @xmath32 the functions @xmath24 or @xmath28 for spreading with formation of liquid or gaseous monomolecular layers can be measured in experiments . in spite of the fact that the proposed models are based on strong simplifying assumptions , one may expect their satisfactory agreement at least with some experiments . in any case , the models allow introducing into consideration various additional physical processes to achieve satisfactory agreement with measured data . usually , when a drop begins to spread in an experiment , the conditions for existence of self - similar solutions are not satisfied . so , in an experimental verification of the formulas presented above , the initial instant @xmath33 should be introduced by the substitution @xmath34 and regarded as some fitting parameter .
SUMMARY:self - similar solutions of the equation that describes spreading of a liquid layer due to intermolecular forces are found . 
 it is supposed that , when the thickness of the layer reaches some magnitude of the order of the molecular size , it turns into a monomolecular layer , which can be liquid or gaseous . to describe the spreading of a drop , 
 the solutions of the equations that describe evolution of liquid or gaseous monomolecular layers are matched with the self - similar solutions with using relevant boundary conditions .

SUMMARY:we report relevant results from na48 experiment at cern sps . 
 na48 was proposed in 1990 @xcite to study direct cp violation in @xmath0 to a level of accuracy sufficient to resolve the inconclusive status left by the previous measurements performed by na31 @xcite and e731 @xcite . in 2002 
 na48 published the final result @xcite . 
 small modification to the experimental setup have allowed na48 to go forward with an extensive investigation of @xmath1 rare decays and hyperon decays . 
 some results are already available and reported here together with the final cp violation measurement .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: many widely used applications read and write documents in a domain specific language based on xml @xcite or json @xcite . this paper and accompanying source code ( github.com/breck7/tree ) present a new whitespace - based notation that can serve a similar purpose but with a grammar roughly one - tenth the size of xml or json . this paper describes the notation and three of its advantages when used as a document encoding . tree notation encodes two data structures . the first is a * tree * , which is an array of nodes . the second is a * node * , which may contain a line of content and also may contain a tree ( enabling recursion ) . tree notation defines three tokens : a node separator ( `` \n '' ) , a node edge ( `` ' ' ) , and a node pair separator ( `` ' ' ) . a comparison quickly illustrates nearly the entirety of the notation :    json :    .... {   "" title "" : "" about ada "" ,   "" stats "" : {    "" pageviews "" : 42   } } ....    tree notation :    .... title about ada stats   pageviews 42 .... tree notation s grammar , while minimal , provides a natural way to represent complex data structures like maps , sets , vectors , n - dimensional matrixes , tuples , structs , and arrays , with or without recursion . tree provides the two base data structures but a dsl building upon those can represent any of these complex structures as well as primitives . any structure currently encoded in a json or xml document can be represented in tree , even preserving data types with an appropriate dsl . in addition , tree notation has a few advantages when compared to other document formats . when a document is composed of blocks written in multiple languages , those blocks may require verbose encoding to accomodate the underlying base notation .    in the example snippet below , a json - backed ipython notebook encodes python to json . the resulting document is more complex :    .... {   "" source "" : [    "" import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n "" ,    "" import numpy as np\n "" ,    "" print(\""ok\ "" ) ""    ] } ....    with tree notation , the python block is indented and requires no additional transformation :    .... source   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   import numpy as np   print(""ok "" ) .... json and xml serializers can encode the same object to different documents by varying whitespace . although ignoring whitespace can be a useful feature in a language , it can also lead to large diffs  and sometimes merge conflicts  for small or non - existant semantic changes , because of different serialization implementations .    in tree notation , there is one and only one way to serialize an object . diffs contain only semantic meaning . tree notation does not have parse errors . every document is a valid tree notation document . errors only occur at the higher dsl level ( i.e. a mistyped property name ) . typos made at the spot of a tree notation token affect only the local nodes . with other base encodings , to get from a blank document to a certain valid document in keystroke increments requires stops at invalid documents . with tree notation all intermediate steps are valid .    segments of a document may be edited at runtime with no risk of breaking the parsing of the entire document . a developer working on an editor that allows a user to edit the document source does not have to worry about handling both errors at the dsl level and errors at the base notation level . the latter class of errors is eliminated with tree notation . while this paper s primary purpose is to introduce tree notation and highlight some benefits , it is relevant to also address a few obvious drawbacks of the language . xml and json are now ubiquitous , with json alone having over 250 widely used and well tested implementations in over 50 programming languages @xcite . tree notation is new , and library and application support , compared to other popular base notations , rounds to zero .    despite the lack of widespread support at present , because of the ease of implementation and intrinsic benefits mentioned above , tree notation may still be worthwhile in certain applications .      some popular formats , including json , specify encodings for common primitive types like booleans and numbers . encoded documents can then be parsed directly to the matching data structures in memory . the base tree notation is relatively bare and delegates the encoding and decoding of additional types to the implementation or dsl . thus parsing a tree document into the desired data structures requires an additional specification and/or parse step . this may not be a significant disadvantage , however . as noted by others @xcite , rarely are the primitive data structures in a base level encoding like json enough to fully describe a structure , and in practice a higher level specification and additional parse step is used . tree s permissive , antifragile grammar enables experimentation and may lead to the development of beneficial higher level notations over time that build on tree without introducing backwards incompatibilities . some developers dislike indentation - based encodings . in addition , a tree structure in tree notation extends over multiple lines , with one node per line , whereas other notations may benefit from a denser display of information , with multiple nodes per line . tree notation can serve as an alternative to json or xml for a base level encoding for a dsl . tree supports clean multi - lingual composition , aligns well with version control paradigms , and has a permissive base grammar that allows for robust runtime editing .    with more tooling support and further experimentation , tree notation may improve developer productivity and enable new beneficial design patterns in document editors . .... tree    nodes : node [ ] ;    new(str , nodesep=""\n"",edgechar= "" "" , pairchar= "" "" ): tree ;    node    name : string ;    value ? : string ;    tree ? : tree ; .... note : a bare implementation can drop the pairchar and replace the name and value members with a single `` line : string '' member . .... grammar tree ;    tree : node+ ;    node : edge name ? newline ?   | name separator ? newline ? | newline ;    edge : space+ ; name : stringchar+ ; value : ( stringchar|space)+ ; separator : space ;    space : ' ' ; newline : ' \n ' ; stringchar : ~ [ \n ] ; .... .... o :   s : title about ada   o : stats    n : pageviews 42 ....

 the classical assumption is that a planet with liquid water on its surface is a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of complex life.
 this entails restrictions on planetological characteristics, such as mass, atmospheric and bulk composition, and sets limits to the host star's activity and radiation properties.
 dynamical considerations are also important, as changes in orbital stability or extreme variations in insolation due to large planetary eccentricities may result in a hostile environment.
 up to 70% of all stellar systems in the galaxy may be multi-stellar systems, and 60 planets have already been discovered in systems harboring two stars.
 investigations of environments that permit planetary formation in binary star systems have progressed rapidly over the last decade.

 do the radiative and gravitational perturbations of the second star influence the extent of the habitable zone significantly , or is it sufficient to consider the host - star only ? in this article we investigate the implications of stellar companions with different spectral types on the insolation a terrestrial planet receives orbiting a sun - like primary . 
 we present time independent analytical estimates and compare these to insolation statistics gained via high precision numerical orbit calculations . 
 results suggest a strong dependence of permanent habitability on the binary s eccentricity , as well as a possible extension of habitable zones towards the secondary in close binary systems .",0.458,0.104,0.174," fueled by the successes of current transit -

TEXT: a first estimate of the total number of variable stars observable by gaia was done by eyer ( 1999 ) . the star population used came from the star - count model of figueras  et  al . ( 1999 ) and the variability detection threshold was derived from the hipparcos survey results . with the new qualifications of the gaia mission , about 1 billion stars ( up to mag  g@xmath020 ) are expected to be observed , with about 18  million variable stars , including about 5  million `` classic '' periodic variables . + very different star counts are obtained according to the extinction laws used ( figueras , private communication ) . since the quality of the gaia photometry in the crowded fields is still uncertain , we can not discuss here the number of variables in dense clusters and galaxies . + about 2 to 3 millions eclipsing binaries will be observed , but their detection probability will be studied in detail in the future . about 300000 stars with rotation induced variability can be expected as well . for a specific interval of v - i , we computed the proportion of variables in the hipparcos survey and we applied that rate to the number of stars obtained from the figueras model ( method  a ) . surface densities were calculated , either from the hipparcos parallaxes or from the specific properties of the stars . we integrated and removed the stars behind the bulge ( method  b ) . we extrapolated the gcvs data ( kholopov et al . , 1998 ) assuming detection completeness up to a certain magnitude and a magnitude limit for the population beyond which no more stars are present ( method  c ) . we also analysed the detection rates of the microlensing surveys ( when available ) and scanned the literature . method a and c estimate the number of @xmath1 cephei stars to be about 3000 . 15000 spb variables will be detected according to method a. applying method a and c gave about the same estimate for @xmath2 scuti stars : 60000 . however , it will be very difficult to analyse the very reddened low amplitude variables . with method b even higher numbers as 240000 @xmath2  scuti stars show up . + with a total number of rr lyrae as given by suntzeff et al . ( 1991 ) we arrive at 70000 observable rr  lyrae ( method  b ) . using the ogle and macho detection rates , we expect 15000 to 40000 rr lyrae in the bulge . + all galactic cepheids are within the observational range of gaia , if not too obscured by interstellar extinction . results of recent deep surveys confirm the early estimates of a total of 2000 to 8000 cepheids . with the help of the fernie database ( 1995 ) , we obtained ( method b ) a density of 15 - 20 cepheids/@xmath3 , leading to an estimate of 52006900 observable stars . + early estimates gave in total 200000 mira and related long period variables in the galaxy . with 500  miras/@xmath3 , 140000 to 170000 miras will be observable . method b gave us a density of 250 - 350 semi - regular variables/@xmath3 or a total of 100000 observable sr stars . + we plan to calculate and analyse all categories of variables stars in more detail to arrive at reliable estimates of all observable variable stars in the galaxy . an example : the international liquid mirrortelescope ( ilmt ) . + ( see ` http://vela.astro.ulg.ac.be/themes/telins/lmt/index_e.html ` ) + an international group of institutions are actively interested in developing a 4-m class liquid mirror telescope . if the view of the ilmt includes fields near the galactic center and all stars from r magnitude 17 up to 20 can be measured with high precision ( @xmath4 0.01 mag ) , the project will yield a unique time series of about 2 million stars with a total of 500 measurements of each star during 5 years . about 10000 new variable stars can be expected , including 6000 faint eclipsing binaries , 200 rr lyrae and 300 long periodic variables . eyer , l. 1999 , balt . 8 , 321 fernie , j.d . , beattie , b. , evans , n.r . , & seager , s. 1995 , ibvs 4148 figueras , f. et al . , 1999 , balt . 8 , 291 gaia : ` http://astro.estec.esa.nl/sa-general/projects/gaia/ ` hipparcos : hipparcos and tycho catalogues , esa sp-1200 kholopov , p.n . , et al . 1998 , gcvs , 4th edition suntzeff , n.b . , kinman , t.d . , & kraft , r.p . 1991 , , 367 , 528
SUMMARY:future space and ground - based survey programmes will produce an impressive amount of photometric data . 
 the gaia space mission will map the complete sky down to mag v=20 and produce time series for about 1 billion stars . 
 survey instruments as the international liquid mirror telescope will observe slices of the sky down to magnitude v=23 . in both experiments , 
 the opportunity exists to discover a huge amount of variable stars . 
 a prediction of the expected total number of variable stars and the number of variables in specific subgroups is given .

TEXT: this star is a known @xmath0scuti star with a variability period of 3.6h , discovered by the hipparcos mission . koen et al .  ( 2001 ) reported the spectral type as f2  iii sreusi , making it the most evolved ap star known . our uves observations covered @xmath2 of the known @xmath0scuti pulsation period , showing broad spectral lines ( @xmath3kms@xmath4 ) with small variable peaks in the line profiles ( top of fig .  1 ) . in the bottom of fig .  1 we present all observed spectra stacked in two - dimensional images for the same two spectral regions . it is clearly visible that three peaks are moving evenly towards the red with a speed of 21kms@xmath4 per hour . however , no spectral features moving at higher frequencies were found in our spectra . to measure the radial velocities of these peaks we filtered lower spectral frequencies and used the cross - correlation method . similar splitting in line profiles has recently been detected by yushchenko et al . ( 2005 ) in two other @xmath0 scuti stars , @xmath0scuti itself and hd57749 . the spectral type in the catalogue of renson et al . ( 1991 ) is given as a3sr and from strmgren photometry we obtained @xmath5k ( hubrig et al . this ap star is located in the same region of parameter space in which rapid pulsations have been detected , but an earlier search for pulsations in the cape survey yielded no detection ( martinez & kurtz 1994 ) . we obtained for this star 15 high time resolution uves spectra . from these spectra we estimated @xmath6kms@xmath4 using the first zero of the fourier transform of the spectral line profile of the magnetically insensitive lines . our analysis of radial velocity variations of ndiii lines revealed a pulsation period of 5.1min . however , there is a potential ambiguity for the pulsation period indicating that also a 14.2min period is possible . longer time series with higher temporal resolution are needed for a more detailed analysis of the pulsational frequencies . from fitting the radial velocity variations of the ndiii line at @xmath76327 with a sinusoidal curve we obtained a semi - amplitude of 0.51kms@xmath4 .
SUMMARY:we present the results of our recent search for pulsational line profile variations in high time resolution uves spectra of the most evolved ap star known , the @xmath0scuti star hd21190 , and of the ap sr star hd218994 . 
 we found that hd218994 is an roap star with a pulsation period of 5.1min , which makes it the 36@xmath1 star known to be a roap star . 
 no rapid pulsations have been found in the spectra of the @xmath0scuti star hd21190 . 
 however , we detect moving peaks in the cores of spectral lines , which indicate the presence of non - radial pulsations in this star .

TEXT: the difference of the structure function for a bounded nucleon which measured on a nuclear target , first was found by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) . it then compared with a quasi - free nucleon measured on deuterium target . this phenomenon is called the emc effect . due to this effect , much experimental and theoretical efforts have been done to investigate the features of the bounded nucleons in a nucleus . + we need a model to account for the structure of a free nucleon and will use it as a base for studying its bounded features . such a model should first include the relationship between the constituent quark and the current quark . it should also be in a good agreement with the dis data on a free nucleon . some papers can be found in which the valon model has been used to extract new information for parton distributions and hadron structure functions @xcite . in what follows we employ the expression of the nucleon structure function for a free nucleon used by hwa and zahir@xcite @xmath3 here the summation runs over all constituent quarks or valons and @xmath4 is the free valon distributions in the nucleon which has nothing to do with a probe . in eq.(1 ) @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the nucleon and valon structure functions which are depends on @xmath7 and the nature of the probe . the distribution function @xmath4 governed by nonperturbative qcd , i.e. , the implication of the factorization assumption . in considering the constituent quark model in nuclear structure function , there are two kind of valons : bounded valons in nuclei and free ones in nucleon . there is a relation between these two distributions which will be discussed in more details in next section . a free nucleon in the constituent - quark model can be considered as a composite system consisting of three constituent quarks . their distribution in a nucleon satisfies normalized condition @xmath8 and the momentum sum rule @xmath9    the sum rule means that each constituent quark carries , on an average , one - third of the longitudinal momentum of a nucleon . the form of the distribution @xmath10 is determined by the interactions among the constituent quarks and is independent of probe . for bounded nucleon we suppose that it still consists of three constituent quarks in the same manner as a free nucleon , i.e. , the normalized condition is , @xmath11    in addition , not only the binding interactions with a few mev do not change the longitudinal momentum carried by each bounded nucleon in dis , but also they do not change the average longitudinal momentum carried by each constituent quark . therefore , under the condition of the approximation it seems to be reasonable to suppose that the momentum sum rule @xmath12 is valid in the same manner as a free nucleon . the distribution of the @xmath13-constituent quark in a bounded nucleon which simultaneously satisfies the conditions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are called distortion factor for @xmath13-valon@xcite . we can employ the same strategy for other constituent quarks . if we supposed @xmath17 then we can find @xmath18 . now we can introduce the nuclear valon distribution in @xmath0-nuclei . our ansatz for the relation of valon distribution in @xmath0 nucleon and bounded valon distribution is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-valon distribution in the @xmath0 nucleus . we call @xmath22 as a weight function , which takes into account the nuclear modification . the weight function for instance of @xmath13-valon , @xmath23 , is @xmath24 we can have a similar weight functions for other constituent quarks in nuclear . we can get eventually the nuclear valon distribution in the same method@xcite as in following @xmath25 and @xmath26 using the convolution integral we can obtain all of the nuclear quark distribution functions , @xmath27    now using eqs.(12 - 14 ) we can extract nuclear sea quark distribution . by substituting the obtained nuclear quark distribution in the definition of nuclear structure function as@xcite @xmath28\;,\ ] ] we find that there are some unknown parameters which initially appeared in eq.(7 ) . all of the unknown parameters can be obtained by fitting the ration of @xmath2 to experimental data@xcite . using the cern subroutine minuit@xcite , we can define a global @xmath29 for all the experimental data points and find an acceptable fit . in fig.1 we presented the analytical results for ratio of @xmath30 at @xmath31 and compared it with available experimental data . we acknowledge institute for studies in theoretical physics and mathematics ( ipm ) to support financially this project . s.a.t thanks persian gulf university for partial financial support to do this project .    0 r. c. hwa and c. b. yang , phys . c * 66 * ( 2002 ) 025204 ;

SUMMARY:we calculate nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , using the constituent quark model . 
 we find the bounded valon distributions in a nuclear to be related to free valon distributions in a nucleon . by using improved bounded valon distributions for a nuclear with atomic number @xmath0 and the partonic structure functions inside the valon , we can calculate the nuclear structure function in @xmath1 space . 
 the results for nuclear structure - function ratio @xmath2 at some values of @xmath0 are in good agreement with the experimental data .

TEXT: in this work we shall present _ universal bimagic _ squares of order @xmath0 and @xmath1 having only the digits 0 and 1 . a _ universal bimagic _ square of order @xmath2 is also presented having three digits 0 , 1 and 2 . these magic squares are based on the date october 10 ( 10.10.10 or 10.10.2010 ) . a magic square is a collection of numbers put as a square matrix , where the sum of elements of each row , sum of elements of each column or sum of elements of each of two principal diagonals are the same . for simplicity , let us write this sum as * s1*.            * * upside down * , i.e. , if we rotate it to 180 degrees , it remains magic square again ; * * mirror looking * , i.e. , if we put it in front of mirror or see from the other side of the glass , or see on the other side of the paper , it always remains the magic square . it is interesting to note that at 10 hours , 10 minutes and 10 seconds of the day 10 , month 10 and the year 10 have only the digits 1 and 0 , i.e. , 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 - 10 . let us divide it in two parts , i.e. , 101010  101010 . thus we have two equal blocks of six algarisms . if we go only for the day , these digits repeats on others days too , such as          we can make @xmath6 or @xmath7 different numbers of six algarisms with the digits 0 and 1 . also , we can write @xmath8 . here below is a * universal bimagic square * of order @xmath0 having 64 different numbers using only the digits 0 and 1 .                instead , considering six algarisms using only the digits 0 and 1 , if we consider eight algarisms using we can make @xmath11 different numbers only with the digits 0 and 1 . also we we can write 256 as @xmath1 . here below is a universal bimagic square of order @xmath1 with these 256 different numbers made from the digits 0 and 1 :                        we can make exactly 81 different numbers having four algarisms from the three digits 0 , 1 and 2 , i.e , @xmath14 . also we can write , @xmath15 . here below is a universal bimagic square of order @xmath2 having only the digits 0 , 1 and 2 with 81 different numbers . we observe that from the above magic square that if we make a rotation of 180 degrees the digits 2 remains the 2 but if we see it in the mirror 2 becomes 5 . obviously , in this case the sum s1 and s2 are not the same as given above . but still it is a magic square . if we want to have the same sum , we have to use 2 and 5 together ( in the digital form ) with either 0 , 1 or 8 . this study is given in the anther work taneja @xcite . for more studies on magic and bimagic squares , we suggest to the readers the two sites @xcite , @xcite where one can find a good collection of work , papers , books , etc . the idea of universal bimagic square is presented for the first time here .
SUMMARY:_ in this short note we have produced for the first time in the history different kinds of universal bimagic squares . 
 this we have made using only the digits 0,1 and 2 . 
 the universal bimagic squares of order @xmath0 and @xmath1 are with the digits 0 and 1 . 
 the universal bimagic square of order @xmath2 is with the digits 0 , 1 and 2 . 
 it is interesting to note that the day 0ctober 10 have only the digits 0 and 1 if we consider it as 10.10.10 . if we consider the date as 10.10.2010 , then this has the digits 0 , 1 and 2 .

TEXT: # # 1 = 4000 = 4000  = 1000 the main idea of the continuum fermion approach ( cfa )  @xcite to chiral gauge theories is to discretize the gauge fields only , and to consider the fermions in the continuum . in order to do so , we need to extrapolate the lattice gauge fields to continuum gauge fields  @xcite . the generating functional for lh fermions in the sector of non - trivial topology with charge @xmath0 is defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lattice gauge field action and the continuum fermion action , respectively , with @xmath4 . the @xmath5 s are the zero mode eigenfunctions , and @xmath6 is the green function orthogonal to the eigenfunctions subspace . whenever we write @xmath7 we mean the lattice gauge field extrapolated to the continuum . the @xmath8 s live on a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath9 . in practice the fermions are put on a fine lattice with spacing @xmath10 , with the understanding of finally taking @xmath11 . gauge invariance breaking effects can be made arbitrarily small by making @xmath12 small enough so that they do not affect the continuum limit @xmath13 ( in accordance with  @xcite ) . the effective action @xmath14 is defined as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the link variable on the fine lattice , with ( for one species of lh fermions ) @xmath17 @xmath18 being the wilson term . for background fields with trivial topology it has been demonstrated , both analytically and numerically , that @xmath14 exists having all desired properties . in particular , @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the effective action of the vector ( free ) theory . furthermore , @xmath14 gives the right anomaly , and @xmath22 is gauge invariant in the anomaly free model . we also did not encounter any problems with large ( singular ) gauge transformations  @xcite , which cause trouble in the overlap approach  @xcite ( and presumably in slavnov s approach  @xcite as well ) .    using neuberger s operator  @xcite instead of the dirac - wilson operator , @xmath23 can be computed on the original lattice due to the absence of additive fermion mass renormalization . the formal continuum expression for the t hooft vertex in the anomaly free csm with four lh fermions of charge 1 and one rh fermion of charge 2 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath26 , and where @xmath27 the integral in the numerator is over the sector with topological charge @xmath28 , while that in the denominator is over the sector with @xmath29 .    on the @xmath30 torus the gauge field takes the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the toron field , @xmath33 represents the gauge degrees of freedom , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the proper dynamical fields of zero and non - zero topological charge , respectively . after integration over the fermion fields and change of variables , eq . ( [ hv1 ] ) becomes @xmath36 where  @xcite @xmath37 in eq . ( [ hv2 ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 @xmath42 the t hooft vertex @xmath43 has been computed analytically in  @xcite with the help of results obtained for the schwinger model in  @xcite .    in this paper we present results obtained in a ` hybrid ' calculation . for the fermionic expressions we use the analytically known formulae , which is equivalent to taking the limit @xmath44 in the cfa . in this way we by - pass the costly calculation of the fermionic determinant on ever larger lattices . the integration over the gauge fields is done numerically . it has been shown that the @xmath45-dependence factorizes out in both , the numerator and the denominator , and that the factors cancel each other if one adopts special fermionic boundary conditions  @xcite . we then find for the numerator @xmath46 and for the denominator @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the gauge boson mass , with @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is dedekind s function . the simulations were done for @xmath53 and @xmath54 on lattices of size @xmath55 varying from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . in fig .  1 we show our results as a function of @xmath58 . also shown is the analytic result  @xcite . we find excellent agreement between our results extrapolated to @xmath59 and the analytic values . we have once more illustrated that the cfa is a powerful tool for formulating and analyzing chiral gauge theories on the lattice . in particular , we find stable results at large values of @xmath60 , which allow us to determine the continuum numbers rather accurately . a problem of the overlap approach is  @xcite that a thirring term is generated dynamically , which has to be tuned carefully so that its effective coupling vanishes . this is particularly aggravating at large @xmath60 , and so far has prevented a reliable extrapolation to the continuum . in our approach , being intrinsically gauge invariant , this problem does not exist . a totally numerical computation of the t hooft vertex is under way .
SUMMARY:we address the problem of numerical simulations in the background non - trivial topology in the chiral schwinger model . 
 an effective fermionic action is derived which is in accord with established analytical results , and which satisfies the anomaly equation . 
 we describe a numerical evaluation of baryon number violating amplitudes , specifically the t hooft vertex .

TEXT: we have developed@xcite two simple models for the @xmath0 gluon plasma equation of state , both based on the use of the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop @xmath7 as the natural order parameters of the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theories @xcite . the first model is obtained by adding a mass @xmath8 to the gauge bosons , and working with the high temperature expansion of the resultant free energy to order @xmath9 . the result is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are simple functions of @xmath7@xcite . the first term , @xmath13 , is precisely the one - loop perturbative result . our second model is obtained by supposing that there is a natural scale @xmath14 in position space over which color neutrality is enforced . this leads to @xmath15\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the jacobian associated with haar measure on @xmath0 . in both models , the @xmath17 term , which favors the deconfined phase , dominates for large @xmath18 . the other term , which favors the confined phase , dominates for small t. confinement is naturally obtained from a uniform distribution of eigenvalues around the unit circle , constrained by the unitary of @xmath7 . in a pure gauge theory , below the deconfinement temperature @xmath19 , the eigenvalues are frozen in this uniform distribution . the deconfinement phase transition results from a conflict between the two terms . in both models , the deconfining transition is second order for @xmath21 and first order for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . both models appear to quickly approach a large-@xmath25 limit . figures 1 - 2 show the pressure @xmath26 and the dimensionless interaction measure @xmath27 for the case of @xmath22 compared with results from lattice simulations@xcite . since both models involve only a single dimensional parameter , these graphs have no free parameters . using a transition temperature of @xmath28 for pure @xmath22 gauge theory gives the plausible values @xmath29 and @xmath30fermi . it is clear that by allowing the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath31 to depend on the temperature , a better fit to lattice data can be obtained at the cost of introducing additional phenomenological parameters . both models show power law behavior in @xmath32 for sufficiently large @xmath18 , consistent with @xmath33 , compatible with @xmath22 lattice data . in comparison , the bag model@xcite , predicts a @xmath34 behavior for @xmath32 , which is ruled out by lattice results . using the information contained in the free energy as a function of @xmath7 , non - equilibrium as well as equilibrium behavior can be explored . for example , in @xmath22 , the range of temperatures over which metastable behavior occurs can be easily determined . n.  meisinger , t.  r.  miller and m.  c.  ogilvie , hep - ph/0108009 . r.  d.  pisarski , phys . d * 62 * , 111501 ( 2000 ) [ hep - ph/0006205 ] . p.  n.  meisinger and m.  c.  ogilvie , hep - ph/0108026 . g.  boyd , j.  engels , f.  karsch , e.  laermann , c.  legeland , m.  lutgemeier and b.  petersson , nucl . b * 469 * , 419 ( 1996 ) [ hep - lat/9602007 ] . j.  cleymans , r.  v.  gavai and e.  suhonen , phys . * 130 * , 217 ( 1986 ) .
SUMMARY:two phenomenological models describing an @xmath0 gluon plasma are presented using the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop as the order parameters of the deconfinement transition . 
 each model has a single free parameter and exhibits behavior similar to lattice simulations over the range @xmath1 . 
 the @xmath2 deconfinement transition is second order in both models , while @xmath3,@xmath4 , and @xmath5 are first order . 
 both models appear to have a smooth large-@xmath6limit . 
 the confined phase is characterized by a mutual repulsion of polyakov loop eigenvalues that makes the polyakov loop expectation value zero . 
 the motion of the eigenvalues is responsible for the approach to the blackbody limit over the range @xmath1 .

TEXT: determination of distances is important task in astrophysics , especially in extragalactic astrophysics . for the study of structure , kinematics and dynamics of galaxy groups and clusters we must know accurate distances to galaxies . our object is a scattered cloud of galaxies in canes venatici constellation , cvn i cloud . the brightest galaxy of the cloud is m94 ( other name of this complex is m94 group ) . neighboring galaxy groups ( local group , m81 , cen a and others ) are compact dense groups with strong concentration to central massive galaxy . unlike those groups , the cvn i cloud is scattered , sparse grouping in the local volume . in our work we derived the distances to cvn i cloud galaxies from the luminosity of the tip of the rgb stars . the cvn i cloud is clearly seen in redshift space . histogram in figure  1 shows a rather isolated peak at @xmath0  km / s , which caused by galaxies in the cvn i cloud . for our sample we selected the galaxies with radial velocities less than 400  km / s . for distance determination we use advanced tip of the red giant branch method @xcite . this method is based on a maximum likelihood algorithm of locating the trgb position and is optimized by introducing reliable photometric errors and completeness function determined from artificial star experiments . advanced trgb - method is especially useful in the cases when the trgb approaches the photometric limit or is poorly populated . the source of images is snapshot programs of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . the observed photometry is extracted from hst wfpc2 images with hstphot package or from hst acs images with the dolhpot package @xcite . obtained color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are analyze with the trgbtool program developed by makarov for realization of advanced trgb - method . the results of distance determination are summarized in table 1 . this table contains the following columns : ( 1 ) galaxy name ; ( 2 ) equatorial coordinates of the galaxy center ( j2000 ) ; ( 3 ) radial velocity with respect to the lg centroid ; ( 4 ) distance to galaxy in mpc ; ( 5 ) positive and negative uncertainty of distance in mpc ; ( 6 ) blue absolute magnitude of a galaxy with the given distance in magnitudes ; ( 7 ) morphological type in de vaucouleurs notation . typical accuracy of the most of our distances is 5 - 6% . such result places confident cmds with considerable stellar population in the trgb region with trgb situated at more then 1@xmath1 above the photometric limit . for some cmds distance errors may be very large , up to 25% . .properties of cvn i galaxies .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: a new version of the inversion code developed by ruiz cobo & del toro iniesta ( 1992 ) to derive model photospheres from solar stokes profiles has been adapted to work with stellar flux line profiles as the only input . the program maximizes the agreement between the line spectrum emerging from the star and a synthetic spectrum , modeling the temperature stratification of the photosphere , the elemental chemical abundances , macroturbulence , microturbulence and the projected rotational velocity . lte and hydrostatic equilibrium constraints are imposed to the derived photospheric structure . starting from a given model photosphere , step by step , the depth dependence of the temperature is allowed to be modified in a successively increasing number of nodes . three snapshots in the inversion process are shown in figure 1 ( ordered a , b and c ) . the evolution of the goodness of the line profile fitting from an isothermal atmosphere to the final result can be easily understood from the accompanying . the tests performed have pointed out the possibility of recovering the temperature in the photosphere from a few flux - calibrated line profiles , but showed how small errors in the absolute flux calibration translate in huge errors on the temperature scale . the possibility of recovering the lte photospheric structure by using a larger number of locally normalized line profiles was also detected in the tests . this means a remarkable advantage , because that information can be available for any star , regardless of whether or not we know the distance to the star and the errors in the spectrophotometry become larger than for the solar case . the method is applied to the sun , the best known cool star , where direct comparison can be performed with other empirical and theoretical model photospheres . the observations entering the inversion procedure are clean line profiles from the solar flux spectrum of kurucz et al . ( 1984 ) , which is available at . the input lines to be included in the selection of solar lines by meylan et al . ( 1993 ) were required , who identified clean line wings in the same atlas by fitting voigt profiles . we also impose the condition for the line that its atomic transition probability had been measured at the oxford furnace ( e.g. blackwell & shallis 1979 ) . a total of 40 absorption lines of neutral iron , titanium , chromium and calcium were entered into the inversion program . the clean wings of the broad @xmath06162  , one of the few lines for which the collisional width is accurately known , were also included . the method is able to extract information about the photospheric region corresponding to the depth range where the employed lines are formed . the derived solar model photosphere is shown in figure 2 . following the considerations by meylan et al . ( 1993 ) to avoid blends , the whole line profile or just one wing was accepted as input data . agreement is found when comparing its properties with observations and other well - known model photospheres :    * limb darkening . the continuum centre - to - limb variation predicted by the inversion model keeps close to the observations for the entire optical range ( figure 3 ) . * continuum . although the observed continuum can not be easily translated to the true one , which limits its usefulness in the absolute calibration of the line profiles , it is possible to correct the wide - band observations , making use of high resolution spectra , to establish a lower limit to the true continuum . the pseudo - continuum deduced by kurucz et al . ( 1984 ) from the data of neckel & labs ( 1984 ) , is compatible with the predictions by holmu ( holweger & mller 1974 ) , kurucz s model ( kurucz 1992 ) and the photosphere from the inversion . * wings of strong lines . we have also checked that the spectral range around @xmath0 6162   is well reproduced by the model . also , the predicted wings of the sodium d doublet , which are supposed to cover a wide depth range of the photosphere , reproduce the solar measurements . it is found that none of the input abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) for cr , ca , and ti need to be changed to find the best fit of the observations , but the fe abundance is preferred to vary from the initially assumed value ( 7.67 , in a scale where the hydrogen abundance is 12 ) to the lower meteoric abundance 7.5    assuming the rotation velocity ( 1.88 km s@xmath1 ) , and the microturbulence ( 0.6 km s@xmath1 ) as known , the code arrives at 1.7 km s@xmath1 for the macroturbulent velocity . from the inversion of normalized line profiles we derive a semi - empirical model photosphere for the sun which reproduces the solar continuum , the limb - darkening in the continuum , and the profiles of lines which were not included in the input data for the inversion .    to better fit the solar flux line spectrum would require the rejection of the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium , introducing multi - component models or velocity fields giving place to asymmetries in the line profiles . work for the near future will point in this direction . we sincerely thank hctor socas navarro for carrying out some calculations for us . we are also grateful to gabriel prez daz , who helped us with the movie work . nso / kitt peak fts data used here were produced by nsf / noao . allende prieto , c. , garca lpez , r. j. , lambert , d. l. , gustafsson , b. 1995 , in stellar surface structure , iau symp . 176 : poster proceedings , ed . k. g. strassmeier ( vienna : institut fr astronomie der universitt wien ) , 107
SUMMARY:an inversion technique has been developed to recover lte one - dimensional model photospheres for late - type stars from very high - resolution high signal - to - noise stellar line profiles . 
 it is successfully applied to the sun using a set of unblended , , and lines with accurate transition probabilities .

TEXT: light simple atoms are basically described by quantum electromagnetic theory . quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is well established and in particular it covers all interactions of leptons ( electrons and muons ) and photons . such a lepton - photon theory is obviously incomplete because even pure leptonic systems are not free of hadronic effects which enter through virtual hadronic intermediate states . effects of strong interactions can not be calculated _ ab initio _ and additional experimental data and/or phenomenological models are needed . here we consider qed tests with hyperfine splitting in light hydrogen - like atoms paying attention to both : basic _ ab initio _ qed theory and relatively small , but most uncertain , hadronic contributions . an application of qed to the bound state problem , bound state qed , is much more complicated than ordinary qed and it deserves serious tests . some of such tests are significant for the determination of fundamental constants and in particular of the fine structure constant @xmath2 , which may be obtained from the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) interval in muonium ( see reviews @xcite for more detail ) .    the hfs interval in hydrogen and some other light atoms has been known for a while with an experimental accuracy at the level of a part in @xmath3 . meanwhile , the related theory suffers from uncertainties of the nuclear structure effects at one - ppm level . here , we consider a few possibilities to perform qed tests going far beyond this level of accuracy . problems in accurate calculations of the proton or nuclear structure effects drew attention to studies of pure leptonic atoms such as a bound system of a positive muon and an electron , the muonium . in contrast to the hydrogen atom , the nucleus , a muon , is free of effects of strong interactions . nevertheless , those effects enter through hadronic vacuum polarization . that sets an ultimate limit on any qed tests with muonium . uncertainties of the qed theory and of calculations of the hadronic effects are presented in @xcite . muonium is of metrological interest due to determination of the fine structure @xmath2 , muon - to - electron mass ratio @xmath4 and some other fundamental constants @xcite . a calculation of the hadronic effects @xcite is similar to those for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite . it is based on the low energy @xmath5 data which accuracy , although fast improving , is still behind the measurement of the muon @xmath6 value @xcite . the current difference between the experimental value and its theoretical prediction differs from zero by almost three standard deviations @xcite . attempts to increase the accuracy of the prediction by adding data on the @xmath7 lepton decays revealed one more possible deviation from the standard model expectation @xcite .    [ cols=""<,<,<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]      +    we summarize state - of - the - art in the precision tests of the bound state qed theory of the hyperfine structure in table  [ t : exp ] . the theoretical accuracy is limited by our ability to calculate higher - order radiative , recoil and radiative recoil effects ( see review @xcite for more detail ) . the higher - order contributions crucial for the uncertainty are related to the same diagrams and thus all tests listed in the table are really competitive . theory and experiment are generally in good agreement . there is a minor discrepancy for positronium up to approximately 3 standard deviations , but statistically that is acceptable if the tests as a whole are considered . the work was supported in part by dfg and rfbr ( under grant # 06 - 02 - 16156 ) . j.  r.  sapirstein , e.  a.  terray and d.  r.  yennie , phys . d29 ( 1984 ) 2290 ; + a.  czarnecki , s.  i.  eidelman , and s.  g.  karshenboim , phys . d65 ( 2002 ) 053004 ; + s.  g.  karshenboim and v.  a.  shelyuto , phys . b517 , ( 2001 ) 32 ; + s.  i.  eidelman , s.  g.  karshenboim , and v.  a.shelyuto , can . j. phys . 80 ( 2002)1297 .

Proceed to summarize the following text. TEXT: the optimization problem of packing regular tetrahedra densely in space has seen invigorated interest over the last few years @xcite . this interest has helped drive up the packing fraction of the densest - known such packings from @xmath2 in 2006 @xcite to @xmath3 @xcite most recently ( see table 3 ) . these improved packing fractions have been obtained from more and more complex packings , with larger and larger repeating units . this trend has led some to conjecture that the densest packing of tetrahedra might have inherent disorder @xcite . the more restrictive problem of packing tetrahedra transitively  that is , so that all tetrahedra in the packing are equivalent ( a more rigorous definition is given below )  has been less extensively studied and the densest previously - reported transitive packing of regular tetrahedra fills only @xmath4 of space @xcite . here we present a one - parameter family of transitive but dense packings of tetrahedra with the packing fraction @xmath0 . the discovery of this family of dense packings was inspired by the results of a numerical search , which yielded a dense packing with similar structural properties to the packing we present . the numerical method used was adapted from the _ divide and concur _ approach to constraint satisfaction problems @xcite . the _ divide and concur _ formalism enables us to set up an efficient search through the parameter space consisting of the positions and orientations of tetrahedra inside the repeating unit and the translation vectors governing its lattice repetition , subject to the constraint that no two tetrahedra overlap . the dynamics involved in the _ divide and concur _ search are highly non - physical , which might explain why our method was able to discover this dense packing , while earlier methods involving more physical dynamics were not @xcite . in this note we present only the analytically constructed packing without a full explication of the numerical method , which will be forthcoming . the construction of the dimer - double - lattice family of packings in terms of the parameter @xmath5 in a general monoclinic coordinate basis ( @xmath6 ) . the packing is generated starting from the fundamental tetrahedron by the action of the space group . a packing of regular tetrahedra is obtained when the general monoclinic coordinate basis reduces to the specified orthogonal coordinate basis . [ cols= "" < , < "" , ] in table 3 , we compare the packings presented here to other studied packings of regular tetrahedra . both packings are denser than the densest previously - reported transitive packing , a double lattice presented by conway and torquato ( which we call the `` warp - and - weft '' packing due to the interweaving arrangement of its tetrahedra ) @xcite , and the dimer double lattice is denser than any previously - reported packing . the results presented go against the recent trend of ever - growing repeating units in densest - known packings and demonstrate that a large repeating unit is not a necessary property of a dense packing of regular tetrahedra . it is curious that previous simulations , utilizing a more physical search dynamic @xcite , yielded dense packings that were either disordered , had quasicrytalline order , or had crystalline order characterized by a very large repeating unit , and were not able to find the denser class of structures presented here , ( reminiscent perhaps of kurt vonnegut s ice - nine , a fictional phase of water that is more stable , but kinetically unreachable ) . our results yield the surprising situation wherein the densest - known packing of icosahedra is now sparser than the corresponding packing of tetrahedra , a solid which just four years ago was a prime candidate for a counterexample of a conjecture by ulam that the sphere is the sparsest - packing convex solid @xcite . as the packing can be generally extended to any tetrahedron in a three - parameter family generated by deformations of the monoclinic coordinate basis , if any tetrahedron provides a counterexample of ulam s conjecture , it is not a tetrahedron of that family . the regular tetrahedron is no longer outcast , as it long was , from the respectable family of convex polyhedra whose largest - achieved packing density is realized by a transitive arrangement . while there are some convex solids whose maximum packing density clearly can not be achieved by a transitive arrangement ( the convex schmitt - conway - danzer polyhedron can tile space , but only in aperiodic and non - transitive ways @xcite ) , the majority of regular and semi - regular polyhedra have been to - date packed most densely in transitive packings @xcite . whether this situation is accidental , the result of bias favoring the discovery of transitive packings , or a more fundamental property governing the packing of a certain class of solids is still an open question .
SUMMARY:we present a one - parameter family of periodic packings of regular tetrahedra , with the packing fraction @xmath0 , that are simple in the sense that they are transitive and their repeating units involve only four tetrahedra . 
 the construction of the packings was inspired from results of a numerical search that yielded a similar packing . 
 we present an analytic construction of the packings and a description of their properties . 
 we also present a transitive packing with a repeating unit of two tetrahedra and a packing fraction @xmath1 .
